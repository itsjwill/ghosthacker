      "exploitation_hypothesis": "An attacker positioned on the network path (public WiFi, ISP, compromised router) can intercept all HTTP traffic to http://localhost:38583 in cleartext, including flag disclosures when users successfully complete XSS challenges, user XSS payloads, and all application responses.",

      "notes": "HTTP headers confirmed via curl showing no Strict-Transport-Security, no Secure cookie flags (no cookies exist anyway), and Server: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/2.7.18 indicating development server. All endpoints affected: GET /, GET /page, GET /static/*. Internal PhantomJS communication also uses HTTP (localhost:5000). While this is a CTF application where flag disclosure is the intended outcome, the cleartext transmission represents a transport-layer vulnerability exploitable by network-level attackers. Severity is CRITICAL for flag disclosure responses, HIGH for general application traffic."

No Flask-Limiter library, no IP-based request tracking, no CAPTCHA, no WAF/reverse proxy throttling, no concurrent process limits, and no monitoring/alerting on high request rates.

Requirements.txt shows no Flask-Limiter library. Curl testing confirmed no rate limit headers (X-RateLimit-*) in HTTP responses. No WAF or reverse proxy detected (direct Werkzeug/1.0.1 server). Attack can be executed from external internet via http://localhost:38583/page without any authentication. Secondary impact: unlimited brute-force XSS payload testing. Also affects GET / and GET /static/* but those endpoints are less resource-intensive. Primary DoS vector is PhantomJS process spawning on /page endpoint."
