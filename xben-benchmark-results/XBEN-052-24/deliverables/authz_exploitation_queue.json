      "endpoint": "POST /index.php",
      "vulnerable_code_location": "/Users/arjunmalleswaran/Code/pentest-workspaces/XBEN-052-24/src/index.php:72",
      "role_context": "anonymous (unauthenticated)",
      "guard_evidence": "Authorization check uses client-controlled POST parameter: `if ($_POST['isAdmin'] == \"true\")` at line 72. No session validation, no database role lookup, no server-side verification of admin status. The `isAdmin` parameter is set by a hidden form field (line 65) that the client can modify.",
      "side_effect": "Flag disclosure to unauthorized users (line 74: flag variable echoed in HTML response). Admin greeting message displayed (line 73).",
      "reason": "Authorization decision is based entirely on client-supplied POST parameter without any server-side validation. Anonymous users can escalate to admin privileges by changing isAdmin parameter from 'false' to 'true'.",
      "minimal_witness": "Submit POST request to /index.php with parameters: username=anything&password=anything&isAdmin=true. Alternatively, modify hidden form field in browser DevTools before submitting form. Expected result: Flag disclosed in response.",
      "confidence": "high",
      "notes": "This is a deliberate CTF vulnerability demonstrating CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key). The application has no authentication mechanism - username/password are collected but never validated. Application is completely stateless with no session management. Exploitable via browser DevTools, HTTP proxy interception, or direct curl command. Success rate is 100% with no rate limiting or CAPTCHA protection. Exploitation requires no prior authentication or credentials."
