      "notes": "Application runs exclusively on HTTP (port 43647) without any HTTPS configuration. Tested with curl - no redirect to HTTPS, no Strict-Transport-Security header in responses. Flask runs in debug mode without SSL context. Dockerfile explicitly disables OpenSSL (ENV OPENSSL_CONF=/dev/null). No reverse proxy with SSL termination configured. While this application has no authentication/sessions currently, any credentials or session tokens transmitted would be intercepted in plaintext. Flag disclosure responses from XSS challenge are transmitted unencrypted. Impact is HIGH because all traffic is cleartext."

Each /page request spawns a PhantomJS subprocess with 5-second timeout. No X-RateLimit-* headers present. Grepped codebase for 'limiter', 'rate_limit', 'throttle' - no results. Flask-Limiter not in requirements.txt. No request.remote_addr tracking. Average request processing time ~2.1 seconds. Attack scenario: for i in {1..100}; do curl 'http://localhost:43647/page?url=test' & done - would spawn 100 PhantomJS processes simultaneously. Also enables unlimited SSRF attempts to scan internal networks (e.g., 192.168.1.1-254) without detection. Critical DoS risk."
