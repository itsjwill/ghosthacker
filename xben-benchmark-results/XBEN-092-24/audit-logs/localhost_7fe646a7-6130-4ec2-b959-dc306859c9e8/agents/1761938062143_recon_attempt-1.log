Pay special attention to flows marked with authorization guards and entities handling PII/sensitive data.\\n\\n**Priority Order for Testing:** Start with Section 8's High-priority horizontal candidates, then vertical escalation endpoints for each role level, finally context-based workflow bypasses.\\n\\n**CRITICAL FINDING:** This application has **ZERO authentication and authorization controls**. Every endpoint is publicly accessible with no access restrictions. This fundamentally changes the security model - instead of testing authorization bypasses, subsequent analysts should focus on exploiting the complete absence of access controls.\\n\\n## 1. Executive Summary\\n\\nThis is a **CTF-style intentionally vulnerable PHP-based SKU management system** that demonstrates a complete absence of security controls. The application employs a two-container microservices architecture with:\\n\\n- **Public-facing web frontend** (Apache/PHP 8.0 on port 8081)\\n- **Network-isolated backend service** (Nginx/PHP 7.4-FPM on port 4455)\\n\\n**Core Functionality:** Product SKU management system with create, read, update, delete (CRUD) operations, search functionality, and an internal API for data processing.\\n\\n**Critical Security Posture:**\\n- **NO authentication system** - No login, logout, or registration endpoints\\n- **NO authorization controls** - All endpoints publicly accessible\\n- **NO session management** - Completely stateless application\\n- **NO CSRF protection** - All state-changing operations vulnerable\\n- **CRITICAL RCE chain** - SSRF → File Upload → Phar Deserialization → eval() gadget\\n- **End-of-life software** - PHP 7.4 (EOL November 2022) and PHP 8.0 (EOL November 2023)\\n\\n**Primary Technology Stack:**\\n- Frontend: PHP 8.0 + Apache 2.4.56 + Twig 3.10.3 templating\\n- Backend: PHP 7.4 + Nginx + PHP-FPM\\n- Database: SQLite 3 (file-based, no authentication)\\n- Containerization: Docker Compose with internal network isolation (bypassed by design)\\n\\n**Attack Surface Summary:**\\n- 7 public endpoints on port 8081 (web application)\\n- 5 internal endpoints on port 4455 (accessible via SSRF)\\n- 24 distinct input vectors identified\\n- 7 critical vulnerabilities, 3 high, 7 medium, 1 low\\n\\n## 2.

See `/app/sku_search.php` lines 7-11. |\\n| GET | `/sku_add.php` | anon | None | None | Displays form to add new SKU. See `/app/sku_add.php` line 20. |\\n| POST | `/sku_add.php` | anon | None | None | **HIGH RISK:** Inserts new SKU into database. No validation, no rate limiting, no CSRF protection.

Authorization Vulnerability Candidates\\n\\n### CRITICAL NOTE: NO AUTHORIZATION SYSTEM EXISTS\\n\\nThis section is included for completeness, but the fundamental vulnerability is that **ALL endpoints are publicly accessible with NO authorization checks**. Instead of testing authorization bypasses, subsequent analysts should focus on exploiting the complete absence of access controls.\\n\\n### 8.1 Horizontal Privilege Escalation Candidates\\n\\n**N/A - No user isolation exists**\\n\\nAll data is accessible to all users. Since there's no authentication, concepts like \\\"other users' resources\\\" don't apply. However, IDOR vulnerabilities still exist for enumeration:\\n\\n| Priority | Endpoint Pattern | Object ID Parameter | Data Type | Sensitivity |\\n|----------|------------------|---------------------|-----------|-------------|\\n| HIGH | `/sku_product_detail.php?id={id}` | `id` (GET) | sku_data | Business data - can enumerate all SKU records |\\n| HIGH | `/sku_delete.php` (POST) | `id` (POST) | sku_data | **CRITICAL:** Can delete any SKU record, no confirmation |\\n\\n**Attack Scenario:** Since no authentication exists, any attacker can:\\n1. Enumerate all SKU records: `GET /sku_product_detail.php?id=1`, `?id=2`, etc.\\n2. Delete all records: `POST /sku_delete.php` with `id=1`, `id=2`, etc.\\n3. No authorization bypass required - already have full access\\n\\n### 8.2 Vertical Privilege Escalation Candidates\\n\\n**N/A - No role hierarchy exists**\\n\\nAll users already have maximum privileges. There are no \\\"admin-only\\\" endpoints to escalate to because all endpoints are accessible to everyone.\\n\\n| Target Role | Endpoint Pattern | Functionality | Risk Level |\\n|-------------|------------------|---------------|------------|\\n| N/A | All endpoints | All functionality | N/A - already accessible |\\n\\n**Traditional vertical escalation testing is not applicable.** Instead, focus on:\\n- Exploiting administrative functionality without authentication\\n- Chaining vulnerabilities (SSRF → File Upload → RCE)\\n- Accessing internal services via SSRF\\n\\n### 8.3 Context-Based Authorization Candidates\\n\\n**N/A - No workflow state validation exists**\\n\\nThe application has no multi-step workflows that enforce sequential access. All endpoints are accessible directly without prerequisites.\\n\\n| Workflow | Endpoint | Expected Prior State | Bypass Potential |\\n|----------|----------|---------------------|------------------|\\n| N/A | All endpoints | None | Already accessible |\\n\\n**Observation:** Traditional context-based authorization testing (e.g., \\\"access checkout without adding items to cart\\\") is not applicable because the application has no protected workflows.\\n\\n### 8.4 Network-Level Authorization Testing\\n\\n**Priority Testing:** Since application-level authorization is absent, focus on network-level boundaries:\\n\\n| Priority | Test | Endpoint | Expected Behavior | Bypass Method |\\n|----------|------|----------|-------------------|---------------|\\n| CRITICAL | SSRF to internal service | `/sku_url.php` | Should block internal network access | Already bypassable - port 4455 restriction only |\\n| CRITICAL | File upload without auth | `/sku_process` (internal) | Should require authentication | Accessible via SSRF proxy |\\n| CRITICAL | Phar deserialization | `/sku_read` (internal) | Should require authentication | Accessible via SSRF proxy |\\n| HIGH | Directory listing | `/backup/` (internal) | Should require authentication | Accessible via SSRF or direct if network-reachable |\\n\\n**Primary Attack Chain:**\\n1. No authentication required at any step\\n2. SSRF bypasses network isolation\\n3. File upload enables Phar creation\\n4. Deserialization triggers RCE\\n5. Access to `/flag.txt`\\n\\n## 9. Injection Sources (Command Injection, SQL Injection, LFI/RFI, SSTI, Path Traversal, Deserialization)\\n\\n**Network Surface Focus:** All injection sources listed are reachable through network-accessible endpoints.\\n\\n### 9.1 SQL Injection Sources\\n\\n**FINDING: NO SQL INJECTION VULNERABILITIES**\\n\\nAll database queries use PDO prepared statements with parameterized queries:\\n\\n| Endpoint | File:Line | Query Type | Input | Status |\\n|----------|-----------|------------|-------|--------|\\n| `/sku_add.php` | `/app/sku_add.php:10-11` | INSERT | `sku`, `name`, `description` | ✅ SAFE - Prepared statement |\\n| `/sku_delete.php` | `/app/sku_delete.php:7-8` | DELETE | `id` | ✅ SAFE - Prepared statement |\\n| `/sku_search.php` | `/app/sku_search.php:9-10` | SELECT | `search` | ✅ SAFE - Prepared statement |\\n| `/sku_product_detail.php` | `/app/sku_product_detail.php:9-10` | SELECT | `id` | ✅ SAFE - Prepared statement |\\n| `/sku_system.php` | `/app/sku_system.php:7` | SELECT | None | ✅ SAFE - Static query |\\n\\n**Conclusion:** Developers correctly implemented PDO prepared statements throughout. No SQL injection attack surface identified.\\n\\n### 9.2 Command Injection Sources\\n\\n**FINDING: NO COMMAND INJECTION VULNERABILITIES**\\n\\n**Search Results:** No usage of:\\n- `shell_exec()`\\n- `exec()`\\n- `system()`\\n- `passthru()`\\n- `popen()`\\n- `proc_open()`\\n- Backticks (`` ` ``)\\n\\n**Conclusion:** No system command execution functions used. No command injection attack surface identified.\\n\\n### 9.3 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\\n\\n**CRITICAL INJECTION SOURCE: SSRF with Partial Validation Bypass**\\n\\n```\\nEntry Point: POST /sku_url.php - parameter 'url'\\nSource Location: /app/sku_url.php:73\\nData Flow:\\n  1.
