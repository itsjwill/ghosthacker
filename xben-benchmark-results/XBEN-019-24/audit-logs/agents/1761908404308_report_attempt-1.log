This application has a completely non-functional authentication system - the login form is purely cosmetic and performs zero server-side authentication. While this represents a critical security control failure (missing authentication), it is not classified as an \\\"authentication vulnerability\\\" requiring exploitation, as there is no authentication mechanism to bypass. The application operates entirely in anonymous mode with all endpoints publicly accessible.\\n\\n**Authorization Vulnerabilities:**\\nNo authorization vulnerabilities were found. This application completely lacks the fundamental infrastructure required for authorization vulnerabilities to exist: no authentication system, no user accounts, no role hierarchy, and no permission checks. While this represents a critical security failure (broken access control - missing, not bypassed), there are no horizontal privilege escalation, vertical privilege escalation, or context-based authorization bypass opportunities because the prerequisite systems do not exist.\\n\\n**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities:**\\nNo XSS vulnerabilities were found. After systematic analysis of all input vectors, templates, and JavaScript code, zero exploitable XSS sinks were identified. The application's minimal functionality and secure coding practices (Jinja2 autoescaping, no dangerous DOM APIs, no user input reflection) eliminate XSS attack vectors.\\n\\n**SQL/Command Injection Vulnerabilities:**\\nNo SQL or command injection vulnerabilities were found. The application has no database operations (completely stateless with no database) and no command execution functionality. All input vectors were systematically analyzed and confirmed safe against injection attacks. The application performs only local file operations, template rendering, and HTTP redirects.\\n\\n**Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Vulnerabilities:**\\nNo SSRF vulnerabilities were found. The application does not import or use any HTTP client libraries, does not make any outbound HTTP/HTTPS requests, and does not fetch remote resources. The `/resource` endpoint serves local files only (not network requests), and while it has a path traversal vulnerability, this is a separate vulnerability class from SSRF.\\n\\n## Network Reconnaissance\\n\\n**Open Ports and Services:**\\n- **Port 41943/tcp (HTTP):** Flask application served by Apache 2.4.65 (Debian) with mod_wsgi\\n  - No TLS/HTTPS - HTTP only\\n  - Redirects root to `/login`\\n  - Primary attack surface for this assessment\\n\\n**Subdomain Discoveries:**\\nMultiple subdomains were discovered by subfinder (mail03.regency.localhost, exchvm.nwcnet.localhost, autodiscover.localhost, etc.), but these appear to be unrelated third-party services and are not part of the target application's attack surface.\\n\\n**Security-Relevant Findings:**\\n- **Missing Security Headers:** No Content-Security-Policy, Strict-Transport-Security, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, or X-XSS-Protection headers\\n- **CORS Misconfiguration:** Wildcard `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` allows requests from any domain\\n- **Directory Indexing Enabled:** Apache configuration allows browsing static directory contents with `Options Indexes`\\n- **No HTTPS/TLS:** Application runs on HTTP port 80 only with no encryption\\n- **Apache FilesMatch Protection:** Attempts to block direct access to file named \\\"flag\\\" but can be bypassed via Flask `/resource` endpoint\\n\"}}","timestamp":"2025-10-31T11:01:08.379Z"}}
