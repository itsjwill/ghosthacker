      "verdict": "vulnerable",
      "mismatch_reason": "User input is directly concatenated into a shell command string without any sanitization and executed with shell=True, enabling shell metacharacter interpretation and arbitrary command execution. No input validation, escaping, or safe command construction patterns are used.",
      "witness_payload": "; whoami",
      "confidence": "high",
      "notes": "The 're' module is imported on app.py:3 but never used, suggesting input validation was planned but not implemented. The application has no authentication, making this vulnerability exploitable by any anonymous user. The container runs as root, amplifying the impact. This is a textbook command injection vulnerability with zero defensive controls."
