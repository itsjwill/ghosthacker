      "missing_defense": "No IP address validation, no private IP blocking, no shell escaping - user input flows directly from request.form to subprocess.Popen(shell=True)",
      "exploitation_hypothesis": "An attacker can access internal services, cloud metadata endpoints, and execute arbitrary commands by providing malicious IP addresses or shell metacharacters in the ip_address parameter. The non-blind SSRF returns full response data in the HTTP response.",

      "confidence": "High",
      "notes": "This vulnerability is amplified by command injection due to shell=True with unsanitized input. The application returns complete stdout/stderr output (non-blind SSRF), enabling data exfiltration. No authentication required. curl is installed in container for HTTP-based SSRF via command injection. Primary CTF win condition: ip_address=127.0.0.1; cat /FLAG.txt retrieves flag{e10ecfcb-fa35-4d78-9b28-5e922c08349d}"
