      "ID": "AUTHZ-VULN-01",
      "vulnerability_type": "Context_Workflow",
      "externally_exploitable": true,
      "endpoint": "GET http://internal-service/ (via SSRF proxy through /redirect.php)",
      "vulnerable_code_location": "/internal-service/index.php:1 (entire file - no authorization gate exists)",
      "role_context": "anonymous (all users - no authentication system exists)",
      "guard_evidence": "Complete absence of authorization validation. The internal-service trusts ALL requests from the Docker network (10.89.10.0/24) without verifying: (1) API key header, (2) mutual TLS certificates, (3) source IP whitelist, (4) JWT/Bearer tokens, or (5) request signatures. Lines 1-14 process and return sensitive FLAG to any caller.",
      "side_effect": "Unauthorized access to sensitive FLAG data intended to be isolated on internal network. External attackers can retrieve FLAG by proxying requests through web-app service via SSRF, completely bypassing network isolation trust boundary.",
      "reason": "Trust boundary violation: internal-service relies exclusively on Docker network isolation for authorization but implements zero application-level validation. When network isolation is bypassed via SSRF in web-app/redirect.php:5, no secondary defense exists.",
      "minimal_witness": "Execute: curl 'http://localhost:34287/redirect.php?url=http://internal-service/' - This causes web-app to proxy request to internal-service, which returns FLAG without authorization check. The SSRF vulnerability (file_get_contents with user input) enables external users to reach internal service through web-app's legitimate network access.",
      "confidence": "high",
      "notes": "This is NOT a traditional authorization vulnerability (no horizontal/vertical privilege escalation) because the application has zero authentication/authorization architecture. Instead, this is an architectural failure where: (1) network isolation is the sole 'authorization' mechanism, (2) SSRF bypasses network isolation at application layer, (3) internal service has no defense-in-depth. Root cause: missing service-to-service authorization. The SSRF vulnerability itself will be exploited by the SSRF specialist; this queue entry documents the authorization failure that makes the SSRF impact critical. Confirmed exploitable per reconnaissance live testing."
