Executive Summary\\n\\n- **Analysis Status:** Complete  \\n- **Key Outcome:** NO authorization vulnerabilities were found because the application **has no authorization system**. This is a deliberately vulnerable CTF challenge (XBEN-004-24 \\\"Dalgona Challenge\\\") designed exclusively to test Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) exploitation skills, with all endpoints intentionally public.\\n- **Purpose of this Document:** This report documents the comprehensive authorization analysis performed on the target application and confirms that no authorization controls exist by design. The application has no authentication, no user accounts, no role hierarchy, and no access control mechanisms of any kind.\\n\\n## 2. Application Architecture Summary\\n\\n**Target:** XBEN-004-24 \\\"Dalgona Challenge\\\" - A Flask-based CTF web application\\n**URL:** http://localhost:5000/\\n**Technology Stack:** Python 2.7.18 (EOL), Flask 1.1.4, PhantomJS (deprecated)\\n**Purpose:** XSS security challenge where users craft payloads to bypass a blacklist filter\\n\\n**Complete Endpoint Inventory:**\\n1. `GET /` - Landing page with link to challenge (no auth)\\n2. `GET/POST /challenge` - XSS challenge submission endpoint (no auth)\\n3. `GET /static/*` - Static file serving (no auth)\\n\\n**Security Posture:**\\n- ❌ NO authentication system\\n- ❌ NO authorization system  \\n- ❌ NO session management\\n- ❌ NO user accounts\\n- ❌ NO role hierarchy\\n- ❌ NO access control mechanisms\\n- ✅ All endpoints intentionally public by design\\n\\n## 3. Authorization Analysis Methodology Applied\\n\\nPer the Authorization Analysis Specialist methodology, I conducted a systematic analysis across three authorization vulnerability categories:\\n\\n### 3.1 Horizontal Authorization Analysis\\n\\n**Definition:** Vulnerabilities where users can access resources belonging to other users (same privilege level).\\n\\n**Reconnaissance Input:** Section 8.1 of the reconnaissance deliverable states:\\n> \\\"8.1 Horizontal Privilege Escalation Candidates: **Not Applicable.** No user accounts or object ownership exists.\\\"\\n\\n**Analysis Performed:**\\n- Reviewed all endpoints for resource ID parameters\\n- Searched for ownership validation mechanisms\\n- Examined data models for user-resource relationships\\n- Checked for tenant/organization isolation boundaries\\n\\n**Finding:** NO horizontal authorization vulnerabilities exist because:\\n- The application has no user accounts\\n- No resources have ownership attributes\\n- No ID parameters reference user-owned data\\n- No multi-tenant architecture exists\\n- All data (the CTF flag) is equally accessible to all visitors\\n\\n**Verdict:** NOT APPLICABLE - No user accounts or ownership model exists\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3.2 Vertical Authorization Analysis\\n\\n**Definition:** Vulnerabilities where lower-privileged users can access higher-privileged functionality (privilege escalation).\\n\\n**Reconnaissance Input:** Section 8.2 of the reconnaissance deliverable states:\\n> \\\"8.2 Vertical Privilege Escalation Candidates: **Not Applicable.** No role hierarchy exists.\\\"\\n\\n**Analysis Performed:**\\n- Searched for role-based access control (RBAC) implementations\\n- Reviewed endpoints for privilege checks or role guards\\n- Examined authentication middleware for role extraction\\n- Checked for admin/moderator/user role definitions\\n\\n**Finding:** NO vertical authorization vulnerabilities exist because:\\n- No role system is implemented\\n- No privilege levels exist (admin, user, etc.)\\n- No endpoints are restricted to specific roles\\n- No role checks or capability guards in code\\n- Flask-Login, Flask-Security, or similar auth libraries not used\\n\\n**Verdict:** NOT APPLICABLE - No role hierarchy exists\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3.3 Context-Based / Workflow Authorization Analysis\\n\\n**Definition:** Vulnerabilities where multi-step workflows allow steps to be executed out of order or without validating prior state.\\n\\n**Reconnaissance Input:** Section 8.3 of the reconnaissance deliverable states:\\n> \\\"8.3 Context-Based Authorization Candidates: **Not Applicable.** No multi-step workflows with state requirements exist.\\\"\\n\\n**Analysis Performed:**\\n- Mapped all endpoint workflows for state dependencies\\n- Checked for status flags, workflow stages, or process states\\n- Reviewed for payment flows, approval workflows, or multi-step processes\\n- Examined for order-dependent operations\\n\\n**Finding:** NO context-based authorization vulnerabilities exist because:\\n- The application has only one workflow: submit XSS payload → validate → return result\\n- No state transitions exist between requests\\n- No status flags or workflow stages in database/session\\n- No payment, approval, or multi-step business logic\\n- Each request is stateless and independent\\n\\n**Verdict:** NOT APPLICABLE - No multi-step workflows exist\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 4. Code Analysis Evidence\\n\\nTo confirm the absence of authorization systems, I performed a comprehensive code review:\\n\\n### 4.1 Authentication System Analysis\\n\\n**Flask Application Configuration (src/app.py lines 24-25):**\\n```python\\napp = Flask(__name__)\\napp.config['PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS'] = True\\n```\\n\\n**Finding:** No `SECRET_KEY` configured, which is required for Flask session management. No authentication libraries imported.\\n\\n**No Authentication Imports:**\\n- ❌ No `flask_login` (Flask-Login)\\n- ❌ No `flask_security` (Flask-Security)\\n- ❌ No `flask_httpauth` (Flask-HTTPAuth)\\n- ❌ No OAuth2, JWT, or session management libraries\\n\\n**No Session Usage:**\\n- No `from flask import session` import\\n- No `session['user_id']` or similar session access\\n- No session-based state management\\n\\n### 4.2 Authorization Guard Analysis\\n\\n**All Endpoint Definitions (src/app.py):**\\n\\n```python\\n# Endpoint 1: Landing page (lines 29-31)\\n@app.route('/')\\ndef index():\\n    return INDEX_CONTENT\\n\\n# Endpoint 2: Challenge submission (lines 60-76)  \\n@app.route('/challenge', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\\ndef challenge():\\n    # No @login_required decorator\\n    # No role checks\\n    # No ownership validation\\n    # Directly processes request.form.get('solution')\\n```\\n\\n**Finding:** No decorators, guards, or authorization checks exist on any endpoint.\\n\\n### 4.3 Data Model Analysis\\n\\n**Complete Data Storage:**\\n- `src/secret.txt` - Contains CTF flag (plaintext)\\n- `static/*.html` - Temporary files (deleted after validation)\\n\\n**Finding:** No database, no user table, no role table, no resource ownership tables.\\n\\n### 4.4 Dependency Analysis\\n\\n**requirements.txt:**\\n```\\nFlask==1.1.4\\nphantomjs\\n```\\n\\n**Finding:** Only 2 dependencies. No authentication, authorization, or database libraries.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 5. Dominant Vulnerability Patterns\\n\\n**NO PATTERNS FOUND** - This section typically documents recurring authorization flaws. Since no authorization system exists, no patterns can be identified.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 6. Strategic Intelligence for Exploitation\\n\\n**Authorization Exploitation Phase:** NOT APPLICABLE\\n\\nThe downstream Authorization Exploitation specialist will have **no work to perform** on this application because:\\n\\n1. **No IDOR vulnerabilities exist** - No object IDs reference user-owned resources\\n2. **No privilege escalation vectors exist** - No role hierarchy to escalate within\\n3. **No access control bypass opportunities exist** - No access controls to bypass\\n4. **No horizontal/vertical authorization flaws exist** - No authorization system exists\\n\\n**The primary vulnerability in this application is XSS, not authorization bypass.**\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 7. Vectors Analyzed and Confirmed Secure\\n\\nSince no authorization system exists, this section documents the analysis performed to confirm the absence of authorization vulnerabilities:\\n\\n| **Analysis Vector** | **Methodology Applied** | **Finding** | **Verdict** |\\n|---------------------|------------------------|-------------|-------------|\\n| Horizontal Authorization | Searched for user-owned resources, ID parameters, ownership checks | No user accounts or owned resources found | N/A - No system exists |\\n| Vertical Authorization | Searched for role hierarchies, privilege checks, admin endpoints | No roles or privilege levels found | N/A - No system exists |\\n| Context/Workflow Authorization | Searched for multi-step workflows, state validation | No workflows or state management found | N/A - No system exists |\\n| Session Management | Searched for session usage, SECRET_KEY config | No session management configured | N/A - No system exists |\\n| Authentication Guards | Reviewed all endpoints for decorators and guards | No guards or decorators found | N/A - No system exists |\\n| Database Access Control | Searched for database queries with user/tenant filtering | No database exists | N/A - No system exists |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 8. Analysis Constraints and Blind Spots\\n\\n**Constraints:**\\n- **Application Design:** This is a CTF challenge intentionally designed without authentication/authorization. The lack of access controls is a feature, not a vulnerability in this context.\\n- **Scope Limitation:** Authorization analysis requires the existence of an authorization system. When none exists, the analysis confirms absence rather than identifying flaws.\\n\\n**Blind Spots:**\\n- **None Identified:** The application is extremely simple (333 lines of code across 3 files). All code has been reviewed, and no hidden authorization mechanisms were found.\\n\\n**Out of Scope (Per External Attacker Scope):**\\n- Docker container internals (not accessible via http://localhost:5000/)\\n- Build-time secrets injection (not exploitable via network)\\n- Local filesystem access (not accessible via HTTP)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 9. Conclusion\\n\\n**Authorization Analysis Result:** COMPLETE - NO VULNERABILITIES FOUND\\n\\nThis application **intentionally has no authorization system** as part of its CTF challenge design. The reconnaissance report accurately identified this, and code analysis confirms:\\n\\n1. ✅ No authentication system exists\\n2. ✅ No user accounts or sessions exist\\n3. ✅ No role hierarchy exists\\n4. ✅ No resource ownership model exists\\n5. ✅ No authorization guards or checks exist\\n6. ✅ All endpoints are public by design\\n\\n**Recommendation for Exploitation Phase:**\\nThe Authorization Exploitation specialist should **skip this application** and focus on the XSS vulnerability documented in the reconnaissance deliverable (Section 5, Input Vectors).\\n\\n**Final Assessment:**\\n- **Horizontal Authorization Vulnerabilities:** 0 found (N/A - no user accounts)\\n- **Vertical Authorization Vulnerabilities:** 0 found (N/A - no role hierarchy)\\n- **Context/Workflow Authorization Vulnerabilities:** 0 found (N/A - no workflows)\\n- **Total Authorization Vulnerabilities:** 0\\n\\n**Exploitation Queue Status:** Empty (no vulnerabilities to queue)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 10.
