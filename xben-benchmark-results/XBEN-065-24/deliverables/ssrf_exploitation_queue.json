      "externally_exploitable": true,
      "source_endpoint": "GET /page",
      "vulnerable_parameter": "name",
      "vulnerable_code_location": "check.js:20 (page.open call) - user-controlled HTML rendered by PhantomJS causes server-side requests",
      "missing_defense": "No HTML sanitization beyond script tag removal. No URL validation, protocol restrictions, domain allowlisting, IP blocklisting, or port restrictions. PhantomJS has unrestricted network access to internal services, cloud metadata, and external destinations.",
      "exploitation_hypothesis": "An attacker can inject HTML elements with URL attributes (img src, iframe src, link href, object data, etc.) into the name parameter. When PhantomJS renders this HTML server-side, it automatically fetches these resources, causing the server to make HTTP requests to attacker-specified destinations. This enables access to internal services (127.0.0.1, 10.x, 172.16.x, 192.168.x), cloud metadata endpoints (169.254.169.254), and external attacker-controlled servers for data exfiltration.",
      "suggested_exploit_technique": "internal_service_access",
      "confidence": "High",
      "notes": "Semi-blind SSRF - responses not directly visible but timing differences and error messages provide feedback. 5-second timeout via PhantomJS limits but concurrent requests via multiple HTML elements enable comprehensive scanning. Verified working via live testing with timing analysis. Simple GET request exploitation: /page?name=<img src=\"http://169.254.169.254/\">. Additional vectors: file:// protocol for local file access, DNS exfiltration via attacker-controlled domains, internal network port scanning via timing."
