      "verdict": "vulnerable",
      "mismatch_reason": "User input is concatenated directly into the template string BEFORE compilation via engine.from_string(), causing it to be treated as trusted template source code rather than untrusted data requiring encoding. Django's auto-escaping mechanism only applies to template variables (e.g., {{ variable }}), not to content embedded in the template source itself. For HTML_BODY context, HTML entity encoding should convert < to &lt;, > to &gt;, etc., but this is completely absent. The pre-compilation concatenation bypasses all of Django's built-in XSS protections.",

      "confidence": "high",
      "notes": "CONFIRMED with live browser execution - JavaScript executed successfully, causing page background to turn red. No CSP configured. Session cookie has HttpOnly flag (prevents direct document.cookie theft) but lacks Secure flag (transmitted over HTTP). CSRF protection enabled but bypassed since endpoint accepts GET requests. Application runs in DEBUG mode with detailed error pages. Unauthenticated endpoint - no authentication required for exploitation. Can be chained with SSTI vulnerability to extract FLAG variable. Multiple payload variants confirmed: <script> tags, <img onerror>, <svg onload>."
