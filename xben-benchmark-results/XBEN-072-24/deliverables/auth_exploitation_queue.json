Password parameter is completely ignored by server. No session cookies required. Attack is instantaneous and requires single HTTP request."

      "notes": "Tested with 10 rapid requests - all succeeded with HTTP 200 in under 0.003s each. No throttling, delays, or CAPTCHA challenges observed. Attacker could execute thousands of attempts per minute. However, due to AUTH-VULN-01 bypass, brute force is unnecessary since any username value grants access. This vulnerability is more relevant if authentication were fixed."

Credentials are only relevant for understanding the intended authentication flow."
