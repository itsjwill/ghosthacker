The application accepts user input through the `?name=` query parameter and injects it into an HTML attribute context without proper encoding. Although weak regex filters attempt to block `<script>` tags and literal \\\"XSS\\\" strings, these controls are easily bypassed through HTML attribute injection with event handlers. Successful exploitation achieved arbitrary JavaScript execution and extraction of the CTF flag (`FLAG{28f92ec34786f6359119bddaca1efa75020daa60ea0834ec3b1682f9a342e3f6}`).\\n\\n**Impact:** Complete client-side code execution capability. In production environments, this would enable session hijacking, credential theft, data exfiltration, phishing attacks, and account takeover.\\n\\n**Authentication Vulnerabilities:**\\n\\nOne high-severity vulnerability was exploited: absence of rate limiting on all application endpoints. The application accepts unlimited automated requests without throttling, CAPTCHA challenges, or delays. Testing confirmed 50 consecutive requests were processed successfully (100% success rate) with zero rate-limit responses. This enables resource exhaustion through PhantomJS subprocess spawning, automated XSS payload fuzzing, and would permit unlimited credential brute-forcing if authentication were implemented.\\n\\nTwo additional infrastructure security gaps were identified (lack of HTTPS/TLS and missing cache-control headers) but cannot be actively exploited as the application has no authentication system.\\n\\n**Authorization Vulnerabilities:**\\n\\nNo authorization vulnerabilities were found. The application has no authentication or authorization system - all endpoints are publicly accessible by design.\\n\\n**SQL/Command Injection Vulnerabilities:**\\n\\nNo SQL or command injection vulnerabilities were found. The application is completely stateless with no database functionality. While subprocess execution exists (PhantomJS validation), it uses safe list-format arguments without shell interpretation, and user input flows through file writes rather than command construction.\\n\\n**Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Vulnerabilities:**\\n\\nNo SSRF vulnerabilities were found. The application does not accept user-controlled URLs or make outbound requests to external services. PhantomJS validation only accesses server-controlled localhost URLs.\\n\\n## Network Reconnaissance\\n\\n**Open Ports and Services:**\\n\\nThe target application runs on **port 42211** (mapped from internal port 5000), exposing a Flask/Werkzeug 1.0.1 application running Python 2.7.18. This is the only in-scope service.\\n\\n**Key Security Findings:**\\n\\n- **End-of-Life Technology Stack:** Python 2.7.18 (EOL since January 2020) and Flask 1.1.4 contain known unpatched vulnerabilities\\n- **Development Server in Production:** Flask development server (`Werkzeug/1.0.1`) is exposed directly without production-grade web server (nginx, gunicorn)\\n- **HTTP-Only Communication:** No HTTPS/TLS support - OpenSSL explicitly disabled in container configuration (`ENV OPENSSL_CONF=/dev/null`)\\n- **Missing Security Headers:** No Content-Security-Policy, X-XSS-Protection, Strict-Transport-Security, or cache-control headers present\\n- **Wide Network Binding:** Application binds to `0.0.0.0:5000` accepting connections from all network interfaces\\n\\n**Subdomain Discovery:**\\n\\nSubfinder scan returned 14 localhost-related subdomains, but these are false positives from external databases and do not resolve to the target application. No additional attack surface discovered through subdomain enumeration.\\n\\n**Technology Detection:**\\n\\nWhatWeb confirmed the application stack: Python 2.7.18, Werkzeug 1.0.1, Flask framework. Application title identified as \\\"Dalgona Challenges\\\" - an intentionally vulnerable XSS training platform.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Exploitation Evidence\\n\\n## Successfully Exploited Vulnerabilities\\n\\n### XSS-VULN-01: Reflected XSS via HTML Attribute Injection in Name Parameter\\n\\n**Summary:**\\n- **Vulnerable location:** `http://localhost:42211/page?name=` (query parameter)\\n- **Overview:** Reflected XSS vulnerability allowing arbitrary JavaScript execution through HTML attribute breakout. The application applies only weak regex filtering (removing `<script>` tags and literal \\\"XSS\\\" strings) before injecting user input into an HTML attribute context without proper encoding.\\n- **Impact:** **CRITICAL** - Complete client-side code execution leading to CTF flag extraction. An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser, steal sensitive data, perform unauthorized actions, and completely compromise the client-side security context.\\n- **Severity:** Critical\\n\\n**Prerequisites:**\\n- Web browser (any modern browser - tested with Chromium via Playwright)\\n- Network access to http://localhost:42211\\n- No authentication required (application has no authentication system)\\n\\n**Exploitation Steps:**\\n\\n**Step 1: Craft the XSS Payload**\\n\\nThe payload must:\\n1. Break out of the HTML `value` attribute using a double-quote character\\n2. Inject an event handler that triggers automatically\\n3. Execute JavaScript that calls `alert('XSS')` to trigger PhantomJS validation\\n4. Bypass the weak regex filters that remove `<script>` tags and literal \\\"XSS\\\" strings\\n\\nWorking payload:\\n```\\n\\\" autofocus onfocus=alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83)) \\\"\\n```\\n\\nBreakdown:\\n- `\\\"` - Closes the value attribute\\n- `autofocus` - HTML5 attribute that automatically focuses the input element on page load\\n- `onfocus=alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))` - Event handler that triggers when element receives focus\\n- `String.fromCharCode(88,83,83)` - Dynamically constructs the string \\\"XSS\\\" to bypass regex filter\\n- `\\\"` - Completes the HTML injection\\n\\n**Step 2: Inject the Payload via URL Parameter**\\n\\nNavigate to the vulnerable endpoint with the payload as the `name` query parameter:\\n\\n```\\nhttp://localhost:42211/page?name=\\\" autofocus onfocus=alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83)) \\\"\\n```\\n\\n**Step 3: Observe JavaScript Execution**\\n\\nWhen the page loads:\\n1. The payload is injected into the HTML without proper encoding\\n2. The resulting HTML becomes: `<input type=text name=name placeholder=\\\"Enter your name...\\\" value=\\\"\\\" autofocus onfocus=alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83)) \\\">`\\n3. The `autofocus` attribute causes the browser to automatically focus the input element\\n4. The `onfocus` event handler immediately executes the JavaScript code\\n5. `alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))` displays an alert dialog with the message \\\"XSS\\\"\\n\\n**Step 4: Retrieve the Flag**\\n\\nThe application uses PhantomJS to validate XSS execution:\\n1. When the page is loaded, PhantomJS (running server-side) renders the HTML\\n2. PhantomJS detects the `alert('XSS')` execution\\n3. The server validates that the alert message equals \\\"XSS\\\"\\n4. Upon successful validation, the server returns the CTF flag in the HTTP response\\n\\n**Proof of Impact:**\\n\\n**Flag Captured:** `FLAG{28f92ec34786f6359119bddaca1efa75020daa60ea0834ec3b1682f9a342e3f6}`\\n\\n**Visual Evidence:**\\n- Screenshot saved to: `.playwright-mcp/xss_vuln_01_flag_capture.png`\\n- Screenshot shows the \\\"Congratulations!\\\" message with the complete flag displayed on the page\\n\\n**Technical Evidence:**\\n\\n1. **JavaScript Execution Confirmed:**\\n   - Alert dialog appeared with message \\\"XSS\\\"\\n   - Browser DevTools console shows no errors preventing execution\\n   - Event handler executed successfully on page load\\n\\n2. **HTML Injection Confirmed:**\\n   - Inspecting the rendered HTML shows the injected attributes outside the `value` attribute\\n   - The double-quote successfully broke out of the attribute context\\n   - No HTML entity encoding was applied to the user input\\n\\n3. **Server-Side Validation Triggered:**\\n   - PhantomJS successfully detected the alert execution\\n   - Server returned the success response with flag\\n   - Page displayed \\\"Congratulations!\\\" message with flag value\\n\\n**Attack Chain Summary:**\\n```\\nUser Input (URL Parameter)\\n    ↓\\nWeak Regex Filtering (bypassable)\\n    ↓\\nString Formatting: value=\\\"{user_input}\\\"\\n    ↓\\nTemplate Injection into HTML\\n    ↓\\nHTML Rendering in Browser\\n    ↓\\nAutomatic Event Trigger (autofocus → onfocus)\\n    ↓\\nJavaScript Execution (alert('XSS'))\\n    ↓\\nPhantomJS Validation (server-side)\\n    ↓\\nFlag Disclosure\\n```\\n\\n**Real-World Impact Scenarios:**\\n\\nWhile this is a CTF challenge, in a production application this vulnerability would allow an attacker to:\\n\\n1. **Session Hijacking:** Steal session cookies and authentication tokens (if HttpOnly flag not set)\\n2. **Credential Theft:** Inject fake login forms to harvest user credentials\\n3. **Data Exfiltration:** Extract sensitive information from the DOM and send to attacker-controlled server\\n4. **Phishing:** Modify page content to conduct convincing phishing attacks\\n5. **Malware Distribution:** Redirect users to malicious sites or trigger drive-by downloads\\n6. **Keylogging:** Inject JavaScript keyloggers to capture all user input\\n7. **Cross-Site Request Forgery:** Perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim user\\n8. **Account Takeover:** Combined with other vulnerabilities, achieve complete account compromise\\n\\n**Notes:**\\n\\n**No Security Controls Present:**\\n- No Content Security Policy (CSP) configured\\n- No X-XSS-Protection header\\n- No input validation beyond weak regex filtering\\n- No output encoding/escaping\\n- No Web Application Firewall (WAF)\\n- No rate limiting on exploit attempts\\n\\n**Why the Weak Filters Failed:**\\n1. **Regex only removes `<script>` tags:** Event handlers in HTML attributes don't require script tags\\n2. **Regex only removes literal \\\"XSS\\\" strings:** `String.fromCharCode(88,83,83)` dynamically constructs the string at runtime\\n3. **No HTML entity encoding:** The double-quote character is not encoded, allowing attribute breakout\\n4. **Case-insensitive but incomplete:** Only targets specific patterns, not comprehensive sanitization\\n\\n**Tested Environment:**\\n- Target: http://localhost:42211\\n- Application: Dalgona Challenges XSS Training Platform\\n- Framework: Flask 1.1.4 with Python 2.7.18\\n- Validation Engine: PhantomJS 2.1.1\\n- Test Date: 2025-01-20\\n- Browser: Chromium (via Playwright)\\n\\n**Reproduction Success Rate:** 100% (consistently reproducible)\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Authentication Exploitation Evidence\\n\\n## Successfully Exploited Vulnerabilities\\n\\n### AUTH-VULN-03: Absence of Rate Limiting Enabling Unlimited Automated Requests\\n\\n**Summary:**\\n- **Vulnerable location:** All application endpoints (/, /page, /static/*)\\n- **Overview:** The application implements zero rate limiting controls, allowing unlimited automated requests to any endpoint without throttling, delays, or CAPTCHA challenges.\\n- **Impact:** An attacker can send unlimited automated requests to abuse application functionality, perform brute-force attacks if authentication were added, exhaust server resources through PhantomJS subprocess spawning, and conduct automated XSS payload fuzzing without detection.\\n- **Severity:** High\\n\\n**Prerequisites:**\\n- Network access to http://localhost:42211\\n- Python 3 with requests library for automated testing\\n\\n**Exploitation Steps:**\\n\\n1. **Verify target accessibility**\\n```bash\\ncurl -I http://localhost:42211/page?name=test\\n```\\n\\n2. **Create automated rate limiting test script**\\n\\nCreate file `rate_limit_test.py` with the following content:\\n```python\\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\\nimport requests\\nimport time\\nfrom collections import Counter\\n\\nTARGET_URL = \\\"http://localhost:42211/page\\\"\\nPARAMS = {\\\"name\\\": \\\"test\\\"}\\nNUM_REQUESTS = 50\\n\\ndef test_rate_limiting():\\n    status_codes = []\\n    start_time = time.time()\\n\\n    for i in range(NUM_REQUESTS):\\n        try:\\n            response = requests.get(TARGET_URL, params=PARAMS, timeout=10)\\n            status_codes.append(response.status_code)\\n            print(f\\\"[{i+1}/{NUM_REQUESTS}] Status: {response.status_code}\\\", end=\\\"\\\\r\\\")\\n        except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\\n            print(f\\\"\\\\n[!] Request {i+1} failed: {e}\\\")\\n            status_codes.append(None)\\n\\n    end_time = time.time()\\n    elapsed_time = end_time -
