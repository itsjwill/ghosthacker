      "exploitation_hypothesis": "An attacker on the same network can intercept all HTTP traffic in plaintext, including any sensitive data transmitted by users. If authentication were added to this application, credentials would be transmitted in cleartext and could be captured via network sniffing or man-in-the-middle attacks.",

      "confidence": "High",
      "notes": "Application intentionally runs on HTTP for XSS training purposes. However, the complete absence of transport security (including disabled OpenSSL) means any sensitive data transmitted is exposed. Verified via HTTP response headers - no Strict-Transport-Security header present. Port mapping: 5000 (container) -> 42211 (exposed). This is a critical infrastructure gap that would need remediation before any authentication system could be safely added."

No request.remote_addr tracking exists in code. Each request spawns PhantomJS subprocess (timeout 5s) creating DoS potential. No monitoring beyond basic print statements. This represents complete absence of abuse defenses and would critically impact any future authentication implementation."
