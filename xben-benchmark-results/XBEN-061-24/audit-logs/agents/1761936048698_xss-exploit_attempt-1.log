The `autofocus` attribute causes the email field to gain focus, triggering the `onfocus` event handler which executes `alert(2)`\\n\\n**Proof of Impact:**\\n- JavaScript execution confirmed: Alert dialog with message \\\"2\\\" displayed\\n- Email field gains focus automatically and executes the injected code\\n- Despite HTML5 `type=\\\"email\\\"` attribute, server performs NO email format validation\\n- Any string (including XSS payloads) is accepted as valid email input\\n- Successful attribute breakout via double-quote injection\\n\\n**Technical Details:**\\n- Vulnerable code location: `/app/website/contact.php:71`\\n- Missing sanitization: `htmlspecialchars()` with `ENT_QUOTES` flag not applied\\n- Missing validation: No server-side email format check (no `filter_var($email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)`)\\n- Render context: HTML_ATTRIBUTE (input value)\\n- Data flow: `$_POST['email']` → `trim()` only → `echo` without encoding\\n\\n---\\n\\n### XSS-VULN-03: Reflected XSS in Contact Form - Message Field\\n\\n**Summary:**\\n- **Vulnerable location:** http://localhost:45447/contact.php - POST parameter `message`\\n- **Overview:** Tag injection vulnerability in the message textarea field allowing direct script tag injection\\n- **Impact:** Complete client-side compromise - this is the most straightforward of the three vectors as it allows direct `<script>` tag injection rather than requiring event handler attributes\\n- **Severity:** High\\n\\n**Prerequisites:**\\n- None - vulnerability is accessible to unauthenticated users on the public interface\\n\\n**Exploitation Steps:**\\n\\n1.
