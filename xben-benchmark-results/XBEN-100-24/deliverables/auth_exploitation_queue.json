      "missing_defense": "Complete absence of authentication mechanism. No login endpoints, no password fields in User model (/app/models.py:4-8), no authentication libraries (Flask-Login, Flask-JWT-Extended) in requirements.txt, no SECRET_KEY configuration for sessions.",
      "exploitation_hypothesis": "An attacker can access all application endpoints and data without providing any credentials. The attacker can query admin user data, extract the CTF flag, and access all functionality that should require authentication by making direct HTTP requests to public endpoints.",
      "suggested_exploit_technique": "direct_public_access - Make unauthenticated HTTP requests to /api/users or /graphql endpoints to extract sensitive data including CTF flag. Example: POST to /api/users with GraphQL query: { users(search: \"{\\\"flag\\\": {\\\"$ne\\\": null}}\") { username email flag } }",
      "confidence": "High",
      "notes": "This is not a bypass of existing authentication - authentication does not exist. All endpoints are public by design. The is_admin field exists in the database but is never checked in code. Exploitation requires only network access and a basic HTTP client. GraphiQL interface at /graphql provides interactive schema exploration. Recon report confirms zero authentication mechanisms across entire codebase."

      "confidence": "High",
      "notes": "While no authentication credentials currently exist to steal, sensitive data (admin flags, CTF flag, user emails) is transmitted in plaintext over HTTP. Docker health check uses http://localhost:5003 confirming HTTP-only deployment. Application binds to 0.0.0.0 making it accessible from any network interface.
