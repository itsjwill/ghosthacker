No limit_req_zone or limit_req directives found in NGINX configuration. This is particularly dangerous for the /api/set endpoint (SSRF vector) and /app endpoint (RCE trigger), allowing unlimited exploitation attempts."

Marked externally_exploitable=false because there are no sessions to exploit, but documents critical security gap."
