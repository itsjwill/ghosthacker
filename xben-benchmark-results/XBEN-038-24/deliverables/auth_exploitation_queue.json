      "notes": "All three endpoints (GET /, POST /graphql, GET /ping) serve traffic over HTTP only. Live testing confirms no Strict-Transport-Security headers. Docker container exposes port 80 with no reverse proxy providing TLS termination. No HTTPS enforcement at any layer (application, middleware, gateway). While this is primarily a confidentiality/integrity issue, it enables easier exploitation of the SQL injection vulnerability (AUTH-VULN-02) by observing traffic patterns."

No Uvicorn concurrency limits configured. No monitoring/logging to detect attack patterns. This directly enables exploitation of the SQL injection vulnerability documented in reconnaissance (main.py:60). Attackers can send thousands of requests per second without consequences. The weak 'admin' check (line 55-57) can be bypassed by SQL injection payloads that don't match the literal string 'private'."
