# Shannon Pro vs Shannon Lite

## Technical Differences

**Shannon Pro** is built on advanced, LLM-powered data flow analysis inspired by the ideas of the [LLM-driven Data-Flow Analysis paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10754). It traces data flows to identify complex, exploitable vulnerabilities with high precision. It's cloud-based with native CI/CD integration (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins) and supports self-hosted deployment.
